The continuing development of density functional theory (DFT) has greatly expanded the size and complexity of molecules amenable to computationally tractable simulation. The conventional metric of success for new functionals has been the accuracy of their calculated energies. Medvedev et al. examined how well these functionals calculate electron density across a series of neutral and cationic atoms (see the Perspective by Hammes-Schiffer). Although historically the accuracies of energy and density have improved in tandem, certain recent functionals have sacrificed fidelity to the true density.Science, this issue p. 49; see also p. 28The theorems at the core of density functional theory (DFT) state that the energy of a many-electron system in its ground state is fully defined by its electron density distribution. This connection is made via the exact functional for the energy, which minimizes at the exact density. For years, DFT development focused on energies, implicitly assuming that functionals producing better energies become better approximations of the exact functional. We examined the other side of the coin: the energy-minimizing electron densities for atomic species, as produced by 128 historical and modern DFT functionals. We found that these densities became closer to the exact ones, reflecting theoretical advances, until the early 2000s, when this trend was reversed by unconstrained functionals sacrificing physical rigor for the flexibility of empirical fitting.Density functional theory (DFT) is indispensable for modern quantum-chemical modeling of materials and molecules (1). At its theoretical core are the Hohenberg-Kohn theorems (2), which show that all ground-state properties of a many-electron system are uniquely determined by that systemâs electron density distribution function over space. There exists an exact functional that yields the exact energy of a system from its exact density. Minimization of this functional at a fixed electron number and a fixed external potential yields the exact electron density and energy, but at an unbearable computational cost (3). Modern DFT relies on approximations of the exact functional (specifically its exchange-correlation term), which tend to provide an excellent cost/accuracy ratio and are believed to be improving in overall accuracy (4, 5). Most of them were constructed empirically; the coefficients in the corresponding formulas were chosen so that energy differences for some chosen systems were as close to known targets as possible. This approach, however, overlooks the fact that the reproduction of exact energy is not a feature of the exact functional, unless the input electron density is exact as well. Hence, pure energy fitting does not necessarily lead toward the exact functional, nor does good performance of a functional in energetic tests reflect its closeness to the exact functional. Rather, such fidelity requires the approximate functional to produce both energies and electron densities close to the exact ones. Although it was implicitly assumed that functionals improve along with their energies, this assumption was never tested directly.An alternative, frequently nonempirical, approach to functional design is based on constraint satisfactionâthat is, obeying the known features of the exact functional. However, this method also cannot guarantee closeness to the exact functional, because the number of known exact constraints is severely limited. Peverati and Truhlar (4) in particular argued that known exact constraints can be neglected for the sake of greater flexibility in the energy fitting.Here, we compared the electron density distributions produced by 128 available functionals with the correct ones [as produced by all-electron coupled cluster singles and doubles (CCSD-full) calculations, which provide nearly exact electron densities for the systems studied]. The historical and methodological trends revealed by this study may provide a helpful viewpoint on density functional development.To our knowledge, correct reproduction of exact electron density has rarely been a parameterization target during the development of currently available functionals. There was an unsuccessful attempt to use molecular electron densities for reparameterization of a three-parameter hybrid B3LYP (6); Csonka et al. also demonstrated (7) that the electron density along the bond in H2 can be reproduced with high precision by reparameterization of B3P86. The HCTH407 (8) and B97-2 (9) functionals were fitted to reproduce the profile of nearly exact exchange-correlation potentials (and thereby densities) of some atomic and molecular systems. Electron densities produced by several DFT functionals have already been tested in various studies [(10â15) and references therein], but modern highly parameterized functionals were not included.An attempt to make a fair comparison of densities produced by DFT functionals imposes severe constraints on the systems available for study. The results for molecules would be ambiguous because for typical approximate functionals, accurate molecular energies and densities arise only from an understood but uncontrollable error cancellation between a functionalâs exchange and correlation components (5). Atoms, however, have been identified as âappropriate normsâ (5) for which the exchange and correlation components can be separately accurate. Failure to describe atoms correctly indicates internal problems of a calculation method, which can be expected to propagate to larger systems.Therefore, we compared calculation results for isolated atoms and atomic cations with 2, 4, or 10 electrons: Be0, B3+, B+, C4+, C2+, N5+, N3+, O6+, O4+, F7+, F5+, Ne8+, Ne6+, and Ne0. All these systems have nondegenerate ground states, so high-level single-reference methods such as CCSD-full provide a standard of accuracy (12). Anions were not included, because semilocal functionals can only bind a fraction of an electron to any neutral atom. Thus, the errors in the densities of anions would reflect not only the functional but also the basis set, and would not fairly measure the relative performances of functionals.We considered the performance of 128 DFT functionals, including most available from Gaussian09 D.01 (16) and GAMESS-US 20130501R1 (17) codes as separate keywords. In addition, all combinations of pure exchange with pure correlation functionals in GAMESS, as well as several notable literature methods available by adjusting functional parameters in Gaussian, were considered. Modern meta-GGAsâMS0, MS1, MS2, MVS, and SCANâdeveloped by some of us (18) were also included in the comparison. The tested functionals correspond to the local density approximation (LDA), the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), meta-GGA (mGGA), and hybrid (hGGA) rungs (19). See the supplementary materials for a full list with appropriate citations and reasoning.To compare DFT with wave functionâbased methods, we included Hartree-Fock (HF) and MÃ¸ller-Plesset perturbation [MP2-full, MP3-full, and MP4(sdq)-full] in the comparison. For brevity, we omit the â-fullâ suffix for post-HF methods.The exact functional (unlike its inconsistent approximations) should perform better with increasing basis set size, so we have used a quintuple-Î¶ all-electron aug-cc-pÏCV5Z (20) basis set for all calculations. It is augmented with a set of diffuse functions (aug-) for accurate description of outer electron density and a set of tight functions (ÏC) for recovering core and core-valence correlation.To compare the density distributions between different methods, we used the local electron density (RHO) and two other electron densityâbased descriptors often used as inputs for DFT functionals: gradient norm of RHO (GRD) and Laplacian of RHO (LR). The deviation of a given descriptor from the CCSD result was calculated as the root mean square difference (RMSD) between the corresponding radial distribution functions. (See difference plots for Ne and Be in figs. S1 to S3.)The historical trends are obvious from the examination of the RMSD values (for RHO in Fig. 1A; see fig. S4 for all descriptors) over years and for different DFT theory levels. The early LDA methods are surpassed by GGAs, and a marked improvement can be seen with inclusion of Beckeâs hybrid functional theory, whereas less computationally intensive nonempirical meta-GGAs show performance comparable to that of hGGAs. However, some of the more recent functionals start producing less accurate electron densities than LDAs produce.(A) The line shows the average deviation, with the light gray area denoting its 95% confidence interval; hGGA* denotes 100% exact exchange-based methods. (B) The bars denote averages of DFT functionalsâ median-normalized absolute error for energy [open bars, Truhlarâs data (4)] and electron density with its derivatives (solid bars, this work) per publication decade.To put the errors in RHO, GRD, and LR on the same scale, we divided them by the median RMSD error for each descriptor (one global value per descriptor; see supplementary materials). These median-normalized absolute errors (henceforth ânormalized errorsâ) are used in all comparisons hereafter. A historical overview of relative DFT performance for electron density descriptors is shown in Fig. 1B and table S1; here, normalized errors are averaged over all functionals and atoms for a given time period. Truhlarâs results (4) for energetics are also plotted for comparison using a similar normalization procedure.The comparison over all descriptors confirms the results seen on individual plots: In recent years, DFT functionals on average are indeed shifting away from the exact functional. To study this unexpected change, a comparison of all three descriptors is necessary. Our set of atoms and ions is not balanced for representation of general quantum-chemical calculations. However, the studied systems can be considered important edge cases: A functional failing at any of these tasks likely has internal problems that will affect the methodâs performance for other atoms and molecules. We also need to distinguish between methods that fail for one or two particular atoms and those that consistently underperform.Following this logic, the best methods (L1, Table 1) should have acceptable worst-case behavior and also work well on average. We consider these conditions to be met by functionals residing both (i) in the top quarter of a list ordered by the maximum normalized error over individual atoms and descriptors and (ii) in the top quarter of a list ordered by the maximum normalized error over descriptors after averaging over all atoms. A similar definition was used to find the worst-performing functionals (L2, Table 2) residing in the bottom quarter in both lists simultaneously. The studied functionals demonstrate the largest errors in Ne and Ne6+, but the ranking in the tables remains mostly unchanged upon removal of Ne-based systems from the comparison (see supplementary materials for details). Full tables of normalized errors are available in the supplementary materials. Another way to ensure the fairness of the ordering is to average the normalized errors over all descriptors and atoms for a given number of electrons (ne = 2, 4, or 10). The resulting table, sorted by maximum error among these three classes, is available in the supplementary materials; its top is populated by L1 functionals and its bottom by L2 ones, with L2 methods showing the worst performance for every ne.Two conclusions are immediately apparent. First, functionals constructed with little or no empiricism tend to produce more accurate electron densities than highly empirical ones. Second, at the level of little or no empiricism, the accuracy of the density tends to increase along with the complexity of the density functional approximation as we ascend the Jacobâs Ladder (a hierarchy of approximate functionals classified by their inputs) from LDA to GGA to meta-GGA to hybrids (19).The list of best methods (Table 1) includes four post-HF methods, 20 hybrid functionals, and three meta-GGAs. No DFT functional outperformed the MP2 method. The best hybrid functionals are mainly three- or one-parameter, as proposed by Becke (21, 22). They often include PBE, mPW, or B88 exchange along with PBE, PW91, or LYP correlation. All the best meta-GGAs (TPSS, TPSSm, and SCAN) are the result of thorough constraint-satisfaction work (5, 18, 23, 24). They demonstrate that good accuracy for electron densities (at least for atoms and atomic ions) can be achieved within the meta-GGA form, as can accurate energetics (5, 18, 23, 24).Hybrid functionals with 100% exact exchange are formally hGGAs but differ in that their exchange and correlation components are strongly misbalanced, so we denote them as hGGA*s. They excellently reproduce LR and are able to describe the two-electron ions relatively well. However, they expectedly fail for systems with higher correlation contribution.Three functionals (HCTH407, MOHLYP, and revB3LYP) demonstrated good if uneven performance: Their maximum normalized errors for RHO were relatively large (>2.1), whereas the GRD and LR ones were among the lowest for studied functionals. If we were to average the maximum errors over descriptors, these methods would appear among the best, which is notable because MOHLYP and HCTH407 are GGAs.In the second list (L2, Table 2), the functionals published before 1985 (including all tested LDAs) and the modern highly parameterized methods tend to produce density distributions that visibly deviate from the exact ones. Unlike L1, the maximum normalized error of the L2 functionals for electron densities positively correlates with their rung of the Jacobâs Ladder (see supplementary materials). Despite their excellent performance for energies and geometries, we must suspect that modern highly parameterized functionals need further guidance from exact constraints, or exact density, or both. For energies and energy differences, the density-driven error (25) could be compensated by the functional error [the error that the approximate functional would make when applied to the exact density, as defined in (25)]. Although their deviation from the exact density is considerable, relative errors in density distributions are small enough to make the trends in resulting integral properties (e.g., atoms-in-molecules charges) similar to trends from MP2 even for a complicated case of a supramolecular stereoelectronic effect (26).We also tested our approach to error estimation for electron densities on the well-studied hybrid functional PBE0. The optimal fraction of HF in it was estimated theoretically to be 25% for molecules and their constituent atoms (27). We found that the dependence of atomic normalized errors on HF fraction in the four systems demonstrating the largest errors in our study (Be, Ne, F5+, Ne6+) closely follows the underlying physical model (27) (Fig. 2 and fig. S5): For Be, F5+, and Ne6+, optimum values are close to 25% as proposed for chemically correlated cases, and for weakly correlated Ne the optimum value is close to 50% (although 25% is still reasonable; see Fig. 2). Be, F5+, and Ne6+ have relatively small energy gaps between their occupied 2s and unoccupied 2p orbitals, whereas Ne has a huge gap between its occupied 2p and unoccupied 3s orbitals. As the gap increases, the correlation energy becomes less important compared to the exchange energy, and the optimum fraction of exact exchange increases toward 100%. The overall optimum value is 26.3%, which is very close to the one typically used, and we obtain it without any energy fitting.Solid lines were obtained by spline fitting of the corresponding descriptors. Minima are denoted by dotted lines.We conclude that the latest trend of developing functionals using unconstrained forms leads to unphysical electron densities despite the excellent energy-related performance of these methods. The meta-GGA functionals constructed by the constraint-satisfaction approach produce much better electron densities, and hybrid functionals with physically sound formulations show the best performance. Our findings suggest that the long-neglected electron density will play a crucial role in the future of DFT development. Minimization of deviations from the exact electron density, along with constraint satisfaction and controlled energy fitting, may result in more accurate approximations to the exact functional, providing new computational methods for molecular and solid-state physics. Overall, DFT is in need of new strategies for functional development.www.sciencemag.org/content/355/6320/49/suppl/DC1Materials and MethodsFigs. S1 to S5Table S1Data S1 to S4References (30â96)Hydrogen spillover1 is the surface migration of activated hydrogen atoms from a metal catalyst particle, on which they are generated, onto the catalyst support2. The phenomenon has been much studied3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and its occurrence on reducible supports such as titanium oxide is established, yet questions remain about whether hydrogen spillover can take place on nonreducible supports such as aluminium oxide8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. Here we use the enhanced precision of top-down nanofabrication14, 15 to prepare controlled and precisely tunable model systems that allow us to quantify the efficiency and spatial extent of hydrogen spillover on both reducible and nonreducible supports. We place multiple pairs of iron oxide and platinum nanoparticles on titanium oxide and aluminium oxide supports, varying the distance between the pairs from zero to 45 nanometres with a precision of one nanometre. We then observe the extent of the reduction of the iron oxide particles by hydrogen atoms generated on the platinum using single-particle in situ X-ray absorption spectromicroscopy14 applied simultaneously to all particle pairs. The data, in conjunction with density functional theory calculations16, 17, reveal fast hydrogen spillover on titanium oxide that reduces remote iron oxide nanoparticles via coupled protonâelectron transfer. In contrast, spillover on aluminium oxide is mediated by three-coordinated aluminium centres that also interact with water and that give rise to hydrogen mobility competing with hydrogen desorption; this results in hydrogen spillover about ten orders of magnitude slower than on titanium oxide and restricted to very short distances from the platinum particle. We anticipate that these observations will improve our understanding of hydrogen storage18, 19 and catalytic reactions involving hydrogen8, 11, 12, 13, and that our approach to creating and probing model catalyst systems will provide opportunities for studying the origin of synergistic effects in supported catalysts that combine multiple functionalities.a, Scheme of hydrogen spillover from platinum to an iron oxide particle over a titanium oxide or aluminium oxide support. b, Model consisting of pairs of platinum and iron oxide particles with varying interparticle distances d and a lone iron oxide particle on a single support. c, SEM image of the nanofabricated model system on an aluminium oxide support, with 15 such pairs and a single iron oxide particle over an area of 3âÃâ3âÎ¼m2 (scale bar, 500ânm).

All the iron nanoparticles have the same initial state, which is the native oxide, formed by exposure of iron particles in air after nanofabrication. Iron oxidation occurs through initial formation of iron(II) oxide followed by progressive transformation to iron(II,III) oxide. A small amount of iron(II) oxide remains owing to its limited oxidation at the interface14, 36. The XAS spectrum of the native oxide state shows a resonance peak and a shoulder. With reduction of the iron oxide, the peak resonance starts to decrease and the shoulder peak intensity increases14.Full size imageView in articleThe fits are extracted using linear combination fitting of the experimental XAS spectra with the reference of metallic iron(0), iron(II) oxide, iron(II,III) oxide, and iron(III) oxide14, 36. The Fe L3 edge XAS spectra in Fig. 2a shows higher reduction for the iron oxide particles at distances less than 15ânm from the platinum particles, that is, in pairs âa1â to âc4â. The initial state was iron(II,III) oxide and iron (II) oxide (Extended Data Fig. 2). During reduction, the fraction of iron(II,III) oxide decreases and that of iron (II) oxide increases. A decrease in the fraction of iron(II) oxide on further reduction results in the evolution of metallic iron(0). The pair with overlapping iron oxide and platinum particles (pair âa1â) is most reduced, producing 16.8% of iron(0). The extent of reduction decreases as the distance between the particles increases in each following pair. The iron oxide particle in pair âc4â (with an interparticle distance of 15ânm) has 1.2% of iron(0) and the iron oxide particles in pairs âd1â, âd2â and âd3â and system âd4â, at distances more than 15ânm from their corresponding platinum particles, have no iron(0).

Initial reduction of the outermost shells of iron(III) oxide and iron(II,III) oxide leads to an increase in concentration of iron(II) oxide, some of which reduces to metallic iron. The concentration of metallic iron, signifying the extent of reduction at each stage, increases further as iron(II) oxide reduces and the iron(III) oxide is negligible. 17% of iron(0) is seen at 343âK for all iron particles, which increases to 33.6% at 353âK as the particles reduce further.Full size imageView in articleSpectra are taken at each of the pairs, at the lone iron oxide particle and in an isolated area on the surface at least 1âÎ¼m from any platinum or iron oxide particles at different temperatures: a, 300âK; b, 323âK; c, 343âK; and d, 353âK.

For example, an often used system comprises metal particles added to a nonreducible oxide support and then physically mixed with a reducible oxide3, 8, 9, which means that movement of particles from one oxide to another and direct contact of the metal with the reducible support cannot be excluded and that the distance between the catalytic particles remains undefined. And although a reducible metal oxide in direct contact with a metal catalyst has been shown to reduce during hydrogen dosage23, it is unknown whether a remote metal oxide not in direct contact with the metal can also be reduced by spillover8.Figure 1 illustrates our approach to studying hydrogen spillover, which makes use of state-of-the-art electron beam lithography (EBL)14 to produce well defined nanoparticles that are then monitored in situ using spatially resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) in a X-ray photoemission electron microscope (X-PEEM)14, 24, 25. This allows us directly to observe chemical transformations induced by hydrogen spillover (sketched in Fig. 1a) in well defined model systems, comprised of different supports onto which we place pairs of iron oxide and platinum nanoparticles at varying distances from each other (Fig. 1b). Figure 1c shows the scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of the nanofabricated model on an aluminium oxide support (2ânm thick alumina) which is an exact one-to-one representation of the design in Extended Data Fig. 1a.a, Scheme of hydrogen spillover from platinum to an iron oxide particle over a titanium oxide or aluminium oxide support. b, Model consisting of pairs of platinum and iron oxide particles with varying interparticle distances d and a lone iron oxide particle on a single support. c, SEM image of the nanofabricated model system on an aluminium oxide support, with 15 such pairs and a single iron oxide particle over an area of 3âÃâ3âÎ¼m2 (scale bar, 500ânm). The iron oxide particles have a diameter of 60ânm, while the platinum particles have a diameter of 30ânm. The distance between the pairs is 1âÎ¼m. d, e, Higher-magnification SEM images (scale bars, 25ânm) of pairs âd1â and âa1â, encircled in green and red, respectively. f, X-PEEM image of the sample recorded at the Fe L3 edge, which shows each of the 16 systems probed simultaneously by single-nanoparticle XAS (scale bar, 500ânm).The 16 distinct model systems, in a 3âÃâ3âÎ¼m2 field of view, consist of a total of 15 platinumâiron oxide nanoparticle pairs in which the distance between the two particles increases from 0ânm for the overlapping pair âa1â to 45ânm for the farthest-separated pair, with the distance incrementing by 5ânm or 10ânm; and a lone iron oxide nanoparticle without platinum in its vicinity (system âd4â). Starting from pair âa1â, where the centre of the iron oxide particle coincides with the centre of the platinum particle, the distance between the two particles increases: pair âb1â shows partial overlap, the two particles almost meet in pair âc2â, and the maximum separation distance of 45ânm is reached in pair âd3â. Higher-magnification SEM images of two of the particle pairs, encircled in Fig. 1c, are shown in Fig. 1d and e: the pair âd1â with a distance of 25ânm between the platinum nanoparticle and the iron oxide nanoparticle, and the overlapping pair âa1â. Our approach to fabricating the nanoparticle pairs, with a particle thickness of 2ânm, circumvents the limitations of EBL26 (Extended Data Fig. 1c) so that we can tune the distance between the platinum nanoparticle of diameter 30ânm and the iron oxide nanoparticle of diameter 60ânm with a precision of 1ânm. This approach was also used to produce an equivalent model system using a 5-nm-thick anatase titanium oxide (titania) support (Extended Data Fig. 1b).To observe any hydrogen spillover during hydrogen dosage, a surface-sensitive and space-resolved in situ single nanoparticle iron L3 edge XAS measurement is performed simultaneously on each of the 16 iron oxide particles to reveal their degree of reduction as a function of distance from the platinum particle. Figure 1f is the X-PEEM elemental contrast image at the iron L3 edge acquired at the base pressure and provides a spatial map of the X-ray absorption cross-section and, thus, the chemical fingerprint of the sample (see Supplementary Video). Since platinum and the support have no absorption edge at this energy, only the iron oxide particles are visible. Depending on whether or not spillover onto the support takes place, the iron oxide particles at different distances from the platinum may or may not undergo reduction, thus interconverting iron oxides and giving rise to the evolution of metallic iron. The extent of reduction is visible in the XAS spectra as increased intensity at the iron L3 absorption edge, corresponding to a relative decrease in the resonant oxide peak, which is further quantified by linear combination fitting14.The iron L3 edge XAS spectra at room temperature of all iron oxide particles coincide (Extended Data Fig. 2), consisting mainly of iron(II,III) oxide and no metallic iron; during hydrogen dosage, the amount of reduction of the iron oxide in the different pairs on the nonreducible aluminium oxide support varies. Figure 2a shows the spectra from three selected pairs and the lone iron oxide particle at 343âK. As expected, the iron oxide particle overlapping with the platinum particle (pair âa1â) is reduced significantly because the hydrogen atoms do not have to spillover via the support and linear combination fitting reveals that this yields 16.8% of metallic iron phase (Extended Data Fig. 3). The lone iron oxide particle (system âd4â) has a much lower intensity at the iron L3 absorption edge (âP1â in Fig. 2a) and does not undergo reduction to metallic iron, which indicates it has not been reached by spillover hydrogen. Likewise, the XAS spectra of iron oxide nanoparticles in pairs âd3â, âd2â and âd1â with interparticle distances of 45ânm, 35ânm and 25ânm, respectively, coincide with the XAS of the lone iron oxide particle of system âd4â, providing a direct proof that no spillover of hydrogen atoms occurs on aluminium oxide over such distances. However, as the distance between the two nanoparticles approaches 15ânm in pair âc4â, there is a slight reduction of iron oxide (Fig. 2a). The reduction in this pair is less than in the overlapping pair âa1â, which has higher intensity at the iron L3 absorption edge; for these two cases, the extent of reduction of iron oxide increases as the distance between the particles decreases. Pair âa1â yields a degree of conversion to metallic iron 14 times higher than in pair âc4â, which has 1.2% of metallic iron; there is no conversion in pairs beyond this distance (Extended Data Fig. 3).a, XAS spectra at the Fe L3 edge measured in X-PEEM during hydrogen dosage at 1âÃâ10â5âmbar, demonstrating the degree of reduction of the iron oxide particles on the aluminium oxide support for three selected pairs (an overlapping pair of iron oxide and platinum particles, and the pairs with interparticle distances of 15ânm and 45ânm) and the iron oxide particle without platinum in its vicinity. The legend of the graph corresponds to the colour of the circles around the systems in the SEM image (inset). b, Platinumâiron oxide pairs at varying distances d and a lone iron oxide particle on a single support, demonstrating the distance-dependent hydrogen spillover on the aluminium oxide support from the initial state in Fig. 1b. The percentage of the total composition of each particle at 343âK that is in the metallic iron phase, which forms owing to the reduction of the iron oxides, shows the extent of reduction at different distances from the platinum particle.Taken together, the data provide compelling proof of a reduction gradient on aluminium oxide support: reduction due to spillover occurs over very short distances from the metal catalysts but not at distances greater than 15ânm (Fig. 2b). In terms of hydrogen concentration, the most-reduced iron oxide particle in pair âa1â comes into contact with all the dissociated hydrogen atoms produced on the platinum particle. For interparticle distances of 5ânm and 15ânm, in which pairs the iron oxide particle is reduced by 2.8% and 1.2%, respectively, this corresponds to 16.7% and 7.1% of the hydrogen atoms used in the case of maximal reduction as achieved in pair âa1â; at greater distances, contact with hydrogen atoms is inconsequential. Because the extent of reduction depends on the concentration of hydrogen atoms on the aluminium oxide surface that is available to each iron oxide particle, we probe the aluminium oxide support using Al K edge XAS (Extended Data Fig. 4a) and find evidence for characteristic three-coordinated surface aluminium adsorption sites (Al3c)27, which are known to be responsible for hydrogen adsorption28 and are likely to mediate the spillover effect.On the reducible titanium oxide support, in situ iron L3 edge XAS spectra are taken at regular intervals during hydrogen dosage of all 16 systems and the structural change in the support around each pair is also probed with spatial resolution at the Ti L2,3 edge. Figure 3a compares the two extreme cases: Fe XAS spectra of the overlapping pair âa1â and of the pair âd3â with its particles separated by 45ânm. The XAS spectra of both pairs coincide at the initial state (state 1), and also after dosing hydrogen at 343âK (state 2, when iron oxide in both pairs is reduced equally). Irrespective of the distance from the platinum particle, all iron oxide particles on the support are uniformly reduced (including the particle with no neighbouring platinum particle within a distance of 1âÎ¼m; Extended Data Fig. 5).a, Fe L3 XAS spectra compares the extent of the reduction of iron oxide on a titanium oxide support in the pair âd3â with an interparticle distance of 45ânm and the overlapping pair âa1â, circled in green and red, respectively, in the SEM image (inset). After hydrogen dosage at 1âÃâ10â5âmbar pressure in X-PEEM at 343âK, the initial state XAS (state 1) and the reduced state XAS (state 2) of both pairs overlap. b, The Ti L2,3 edge XAS of the initial state and after hydrogen spillover from platinum at 343âK. Equal surface reduction takes place around all 16 systems and in an isolated area far from the platinum (inset, SEM image). c, The Ti L2,3 edge XAS spectra of the initial state and after hydrogen dosage up to 425âK for a sample without platinum nanoparticles. There is no observable reduction of titanium oxide. d, Illustration of spillover on titanium oxide at 343âK from the initial state in Fig. 1b. All the iron oxide particles as well as the titanium oxide support reduce simultaneously, irrespective of their distance d from the platinum particles. A maximum reduction of 17% occurs for all iron oxide particles at this stage.Linear combination fitting reveals the evolution of 17% metallic iron at this stage (Extended Data Fig. 6). Furthermore, the titanium oxide XAS spectra29 show uniform reduction from Ti4+ to Ti3+ over its surface (Fig. 3b) for all 16 systems and even at a large distance from the platinum catalyst (Extended Data Fig. 7). A control experiment using a fresh sample of titanium oxide lacking platinum particles resulted in no support reduction with hydrogen dosage at temperatures up to 425âK (Fig. 3c), confirming the crucial role of both the platinum particles and the fast spillover of the dissociated hydrogen atoms onto and subsequent diffusion over the support until equilibrium is reached. The hydrogen atoms then react with each of the iron oxide particles, regardless of their distance from the platinum nanoparticles (Fig. 3d).To probe the mechanism of hydrogen adsorption and migration on anatase titanium oxide and the Î³-aluminium oxide supports, we use first-principles atomistic simulations16, 17 that show spontaneous dissociation of hydrogen on the platinum cluster independent of the support (Fig. 4a). Under the experimental conditions (Extended Data Fig. 8), the barrier for spillover of dissociated hydrogen onto anatase is 0.45âeV. A slightly higher proportion of energy, between 0.6âeV and 0.7âeV, is required to transfer an electron and a proton among the different titanium oxide sites (Fig. 4b), which yields a diffusion coefficient D of 4.2âÃâ10â14âcm2 sâ1 at 300âK. This mobility is not influenced by the presence of water on the surface (Fig. 4b, Extended Data Figs 8 and 9) and desorption of hydrogen, requiring about 2.45âeV (Extended Data Fig. 10), is energetically improbable. The combination of these factors results in an almost instantaneous reduction of the titanium oxide across the surface, leading to the reduction of iron oxide particles, independent of their distance from platinum (Fig. 3).The method used was nudged elastic band (NEB); see Methods. The results corroborate experimental observations. All energies are normalized to the energy of the isolated hydrogen molecule in the gas phase. In the ball-and-stick models the main stages of hydrogen adsorption and migration are illustrated. A is the gas-phase hydrogen molecule. C is hydrogen adsorbed on the metal oxide. D and E are intermediate configurations. Labels with an asterisk refer to transition states. Labels CâCâ² and DâDâ² denote equivalent sites.

These species compete for the same Al3c adsorption sites as those exposed on the [100] interface and that are fundamental for aluminium oxide reactivity (Methods and Extended Data Figs 4 and 10). The more water there is, the lower is the amount of Al3c sites and the lower is the hydrogen coverage28. Spectroscopic evidence of such sites (Extended Data Fig. 4a), with well established28 water-dependent availability (Extended Data Fig. 4b), supports the idea that not all under-coordinated aluminium sites are hydrated under the experimental conditions. The transfer of the reducing species between neighbouring aluminium oxide sites has an activation energy barrier ranging from 1.15âeV to 1.63âeV, depending on the hydration of the surface (Fig. 4c). Furthermore, the hydrogen desorption energy of dehydrated aluminium oxide is 1.55âeV and can be as low as 0.38âeV for aluminium oxide with high water coverage (Extended Data Fig. 10). The hydrogen desorption rate is, therefore, faster or comparable to the surface mobility, causing a gradient in hydrogen coverage of the surface.Thus, in agreement with previous theoretical and experimental work28, 30, our calculations (Extended Data Fig. 4b) suggest that there is a strong effect of water on aluminium oxide and that hydrogen mobility on its surface is much more restricted than on titanium oxide, with a diffusion coefficient of 1.4âÃâ10â23âcm2 sâ1 at 300âK (which is about 1010 times lower than the corresponding diffusion coefficient on titanium oxide). The lower activation energy for detachment of hydrogen in competition with the slow hydrogen diffusion leads to a rapidly decreasing hydrogen concentration as the distance from platinum increases and in accordance with the distance-dependent reduction of the iron nanoparticles (Fig. 2).In summary, our work clearly documents the efficiency of hydrogen spillover on reducible surfaces such as titanium oxide: it gives rise to uniform support reduction and even reduces a remote metal oxide that is not in direct contact with the platinum catalyst, irrespective of distance. Spillover on the nonreducible support aluminium oxide is vastly slower and limited to short distances, with the hydrogen flux decreasing over distance to create a concentration gradient. Looking forward, we anticipate that the use of nanofabrication of a unique model system in combination with single-particle spectroscopy will also prove valuable when exploring other fundamental questions in heterogeneous catalysis.Although a number of studies have tackled spillover using approaches such as single-particle surface plasmon spectroscopy7, resonant photoemission spectroscopy20, infrared spectroscopy22, scanning tunnelling microscope imaging21 and the âmolecular corkâ effect5, others have introduced designs of model systems using platinum-encapsulated aluminosilicates6. Model systems that adhere to the accepted definition of hydrogen spillover should, ideally, incorporate a metal catalyst and the reacting species on the same support with precise positioning of particles without contamination (Fig. 1a), and this has to be probed in order to observe the spillover of hydrogen between them.We employed top-down nanofabrication to create model systems containing pairs of particles at precisely defined distances on aluminium oxide (alumina) and titanium oxide (titania), a nonreducible and a reducible support respectively. Fabrication of the model system was based on the design in Extended Data Fig. 1a. The exact one-to-one match between the design and the model system was achieved on aluminium oxide and titanium oxide supports (SEM images in Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1b) by means of a three-step EBL overlay exposure shown in the scheme in Extended Data Fig. 1c. The supports were prepared by atomic layer deposition at 500âK of the 5-nm-thick layer of titanium oxide and the 2-nm-thick layer of aluminium oxide on a 1âÃâ1âcm2 silicon wafer with its native oxide. A thin film of aluminium oxide was obtained using trimethylaluminum precursor31 in the Ultratech/Cambridge NanoTech atomic layer deposition system. The tetrakis(dimethylamido)titanium(IV) precursor yields anatase titanium oxide32. These thin films helped to overcome the charging associated with insulating substrates, such as oxides and semiconductors, during measurements in the X-PEEM. Once the support was prepared, the first EBL step at the Vistec EBPG 5000PlusES tool involved fabrication of markers on the support, which helped with alignment of the tool for further lithography steps and processing. Further processing steps are shown in Extended Data Fig. 1c, which initially involved spin-coating of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) resist (Extended Data Fig. 1c (i)). This was followed by EBL exposure of nanoholes using proximity effect correction (Extended Data Fig. 1c (ii)), thermal deposition of iron (Extended Data Fig. 1c (iii)), and lift-off resulting in a 4âÃâ4 array of iron nanoparticles with diameter 60ânm and thickness 2ânm (Extended Data Fig. 1c (iv)).Exposure of iron(0) to the ambient environment after sample preparation leads to the oxidation of the particles to iron oxide. The exposure to ambient air does not occur instantaneously. Instead, our samples are situated in a vacuum chamber, which after successful sample preparation, is gradually vented to atmospheric pressure over half an hour. The resulting chemical reaction heat is therefore only gradually released and there is sufficient time for the nanostructures to equilibrate thermally with the substrate, which is held at room temperature. Using the alignment markers, a third EBL step was performed on PMMA in a similar manner (Extended Data Fig. 1c (v)) with nanoholes positioned at varying distances from the iron oxide nanoparticles (Extended Data Fig. 1c (vi)), followed by electron-beam-assisted physical vapour deposition of platinum (Extended Data Fig. 1c (vii)) and lift-off to achieve platinum nanoparticles of diameter 30ânm and thickness 2ânm (Extended Data Fig. 1c (viii)). This resulted in the desired pairs of iron oxide and platinum nanoparticles.Sub-10-nm resolution is difficult to achieve using EBL26 and, despite the usage of alignment markers, multiple EBL steps can result in a positioning error of Â±30ânm in both axes, depending on the regulated design of the alignment markers and the charging effects associated with the substrate, which is well below the required precision for the interparticle distance. To circumvent this problem, we applied an approach that involved fabrication of a large array of the model system (Extended Data Fig. 1a) on the same support. This was done using a 13âÃâ13 array of the model in Extended Data Fig. 1a, each separated by 10âÎ¼m. The centre of the array corresponds to the design in Extended Data Fig. 1a and the platinum particles are shifted by 2ânm on the right, left, bottom and centre in the models in the respective directions, whereas the 16 iron oxide particles do not change position. Therefore, the drift of the electron beam in overlay exposure is compensated in the xây direction by scanning all errors greater than 1ânm. Since the random EBL error is constant during an overlay exposure step, we scan all possible errors. In this way, one of the 169 models on the surface always corresponded to exactly the design in Extended Data Fig. 1a, determined by SEM analysis after nanofabrication and the distance is also measured with 1ânm precision. This gave complete control over interparticle distance and the correct sets of dimers were identified for spectromicroscopy. This nanofabrication strategy yields a precision of 1ânm for particle placement, which resulted in the same model system on both the supports, demonstrating very high reproducibility. Such model surfaces with two particles separated by a controlled distance on a single support present a unique opportunity to elucidate chemical action at a distance from the metal in fundamental catalytic reactions.The spectromicroscopy data was acquired in the X-PEEM at the Surfaces/Interfaces Microscopy beamline in the Swiss Light Source, which enabled single-nanoparticle XAS. To avoid interactions between the pairs and overlapping of their signals, the distance between the 16 iron oxide particles was 1âÎ¼m, since the X-ray PEEM has a spatial resolution14, 25, 33 of about 50â100ânm. The particle thickness is chosen as 2ânm so that the whole particle is probed (the PEEM is a surface-sensitive technique probing a depth of about 3ânm). A field-of-view of 5âÃâ5âÎ¼m2 is chosen in the PEEM microscope to accommodate the full model surface with the 16 systems over an area of 3âÃâ3âÎ¼m2 in each image, which allows simultaneous measurement for all pairs (Fig. 1f). X-PEEM images are recorded at the range of photon energies 700â718âeV to generate the sequence of the Fe L3 edge XAS spectra (see Supplementary Video), for 453â475âeV for Ti L2,3 edge XAS in the case of the titanium oxide support and for 1,550â1,590âeV for Al K edge XAS when the aluminium oxide support is used. X-PEEM is superior to other XAS techniques for measuring the aluminium oxide support since it is a surface-sensitive method, not measuring the bulk, and detects small changes in surface coordination that were identified in previous studies27, 34. The series of images in each energy scan are corrected for drift, followed by selection of the desired area on the support or the desired nanoparticle to obtain the spatially resolved individual XAS spectra. Normalization of the spectra is done with a marker that has no absorption edges in the energy range where the XAS spectra are taken. The base pressure of the X-PEEM was around 5âÃâ10â10âmbar. During hydrogen dosage at 1âÃâ10â5âmbar and a gradual increase in temperature, dissociation of hydrogen occurs on the platinum nanoparticles, which initiates the spillover effect. Direct reduction of iron oxides to metallic iron(0) in molecular hydrogen occurs only at very high temperature (above 650âK; ref. 35), with no changes in the XAS spectra below 423âK (ref. 14). Therefore, the measurements are performed well below this temperature to account for the partial reduction due only to hydrogen atoms spilling over from platinum.Alignment of the microscope, stabilization of any drifts in the sample, and obtaining the XAS spectra took an hour at each temperature step, which was kept consistent for both the titanium oxide and the aluminium oxide sample. Beginning at room temperature, the sample temperature was increased in steps of 10âK or 20âK. A crucial balance between the space and time resolution of the X-PEEM microscope and the limits of the dosing under ultrahigh vacuum was maintained. At each temperature, spectra for all 16 iron oxide particles were extracted in the same single measurement to compare exactly the same reaction condition for every pair. Further data analysis and speciation of iron oxide spectra is done using linear combination fitting with the reference of the oxides14, 36. The XAS spectrum of the native oxide state shows a resonance peak and a shoulder. With reduction of the iron oxide, the intensity of the peak resonance starts to decrease, eventually disappearing when fully reduced14, 25, and the shoulder peak intensity increases, eventually to become dominant. Visualization of the whole model system during spectroscopic analysis enables a comparison of the extent of spillover in the different pairs.From the extent of reduction, it is possible to quantify the percentage of dissociated hydrogen available at different distances from platinum (that is, the concentration gradient). At the experimental stage shown in Fig. 2, all the hydrogen atoms dissociated on platinum in the overlapping pair âa1â contribute to the reduction of the iron oxide particle, which reduced by 16.8% as determined by linear combination fitting of the iron L3 edge XAS. Iron oxide is reduced by 5%, 2.8% and 1.2% in pairs âc2â, âc3â and âc4â respectively. Since the amount of reduction is proportional to the hydrogen atoms used at that particle, using simple proportionality, we calculate the hydrogen concentration available at the iron oxide of each pair in comparison to pair âa1â (where 16.8% reduction corresponds to 100% hydrogen concentration): in pair âc2â, where the pairs touch each other, it is 29.8%; in pair âc3â, at a distance of 5ânm, it is 16.7%; this drops to as low as 7.1% in pair âc4â, at a distance of 15ânm from the platinum; and it becomes insignificant as distance increases. Using the results from in situ single nanoparticle spectromicroscopy14 and DFT simulations16, 17, 37, 38, the mechanism of hydrogen spillover in relation to the distance from the platinum catalyst was fully quantified. DFT calculations and the diffusion coefficients corroborate the greater mobility on titanium oxide as compared to under-coordinated Al3c sites in aluminium oxide.First principles DFT calculations were carried out with the CP2K package (http://www.cp2k.org), based on the hybrid Gaussian and plane-wave scheme16, 39. A plane-wave density cutoff of 800 Ry and periodic boundary conditions were adopted. For a better understanding of the semiconductor electronic properties, we used both general gradient approximation and hybrid functionals. General gradient approximation calculations were performed with the PerdewâBurkeâEnzerhof (PBE)40 exchange correlation functional, while hybrid calculations were carried out with the truncated PBE0 functional41, 42, with varying percentages of exact HartreeâFock exchange, ranging from 25% to 35%. A cutoff radius of 4.5âÃ, sufficient to ensure converged electronic properties in the truncated PBE0 calculations43, was chosen for all calculations with the truncated PBE0 functional. The auxiliary density matrix method, which relies on an auxiliary basis for HartreeâFock exchange44, was used to speed up hybrid calculations. Dispersion interactions were included by means of an empirical analytical potential, using the Grimme D3 method45, within a range of 15âÃ.Standard coefficients and scaling factors for PBE and PBE0 functionals were adopted. The primary Gaussian basis set adopted in all calculations is of double Î¶ quality for all elements, apart from hydrogen (triple Î¶ quality), in combination with GoedeckerâTeterâHutter pseudopotentials46. Validation of the computational setup was carried out for both titanium oxide and aluminium oxide, by comparison with experimental lattice parameters and bond lengths. Differences between computed and experimental parameters were generally less than 1%. Activation energies were computed with the climbing image NEB method47, 48 with a convergence limit of 2âÃâ10â5âeV. Density of states analysis was carried out with a resolution of 0.03âeV. The thermodynamically most stable (101) surface was chosen as a model for the anatase titanium oxide interface49, 50. The bohemite-based crystal structure of Î³-aluminium oxide proposed in ref. 51 and confirmed by theoretical calculations30 was adopted in our model system. Its two most stable surfaces (001) and (100) were investigated and their properties compared. In all modelled slabs, the interface under study was built to be perpendicular to the z axis, facing a vacuum layer about 20âÃ thick, whereas the x and y directions are fully periodic.Assessment of the interaction of hydrogen with the anatase and aluminium oxide surfaces is a fundamental step of the investigation. The adsorption energy of a hydrogen molecule on a given surface is computed as:where E2H, surface is the total energy of the hydrogenated surface, Esurface, clean is the total energy of the clean surface, and 																											 is the energy of hydrogen in vacuum, not interacting with the surface. Direct comparison to hydrogen in vacuum phase avoids the bias due to the intrinsic instability of a single hydrogen atom in vacuum. The adsorption energy of a single hydrogen atom can then be computed as:Dissociative hydrogen adsorption on anatase (101) is energetically favourable, and the oxide slab is reduced, with transfer of two electrons to the substrate.Hydrogen adsorption was investigated on both the (100) and (001) interfaces of Î³-aluminium oxide. The process is favourable only at the (100) interface, as it is the one exposing the highly reactive Al3c centres, with an undercoordinated tetrahedral geometry28. On aluminium oxide, hydrogen is heterolytically split, forming a proton and a Hâ anion, which remain segregated at the interface. Analysis of the spin density distribution and of the system total density of states shows that there is no formation of trap states in the oxide band structure, confirming that no excess electronic density is transferred to the oxide.Adsorption on a 13-atom platinum cluster (Pt13) was also investigated. Adsorption of the cluster on the oxide was modelled by placing the 13 metal atoms on the surface with three different possible geometries (cuboctahedron and an amorphous two- and three-layered structure) and then letting the system evolve with a molecular dynamics simulation for approximately 5 ps each at 700âK. Cluster geometry samples were obtained at every 1,000th molecular dynamics step, and subsequently the geometry relaxed. The lowest energy cluster geometry was selected as a reasonable approximation for the metal geometry. In agreement with refs 52 and 53, adsorption of a single hydrogen atom on the oxide-supported metal is exothermic, indicating an energetically favourable process. An effect of metal loading, similar to that reported by ref. 54, was also observed: adsorption of a single hydrogen molecule is more favourable on the metal cluster than on the oxide (that is, about â1.5âeV on Pt13 versus about â0.6âeV on titanium oxide). However, the average hydrogen adsorption energy decreases linearly with increasing H coverage of the metal cluster, making hydrogen adsorption on the oxide energetically competitive at the coverage level, which can be predicted under the experimental conditions (that is, about â0.5âeV on Pt13 versus about â0.5âeV on titanium oxide; for the prediction of coverage, see below). As reported in the main text, we demonstrate that increasing the hydrogen loading of the metal not only affects the adsorption energies, but also significantly lowers the spillover activation energy Eact barriers.Additional NEB calculations also reveal that hydrogen dissociation on a clear titanium oxide support without any metal particles requires an Eact of 2.05âeV, suggesting that titanium oxide is not directly reduced by gas-phase hydrogen (Extended Data Fig. 10a), in agreement with experimental observations (Fig. 3c). The computed Eact for migration of hydrogen atoms on the anatase surface matches well with the value reported by ref. 55, in which computations are carried out at a lower level of theory (general gradient approximation) that does not allow for polaron formation in the oxide. Adopting a higher level of theory proves to be crucial for assessing the role of coadsorbed water molecules on the surface, as their presence could initiate a Grotthus-like charge transfer. The energy barrier associated with the single proton migration decreases from 0.68âeV to 0.15âeV in the presence of a bridging water molecule. On the other hand, when electrons are involved, Eact is more or less unaltered, even in the presence of a bridging water molecule (0.71âeV). Electrons migrate within the oxide, from one Ti site to another, without transferring to the water molecule. The migration profile shows a first peak, corresponding to proton transfer between the two neighbouring surface oxygen centres, immediately followed by a barrier-less electron transfer (see also Extended Data Fig. 9). The barrier for migration of the other possible reducing defects in titanium oxide, oxygen vacancies, is much higher (Eactâ>â1âeV) for âlateralâ migration and therefore formation of Ti3+ centres away from the platinum cluster is explained by the migration of the excess electrons that are introduced with oxide hydrogenation. The barrier for subsurface vacancy intercalation (that is, âverticalâ migration) is lower and comparable to hydrogen mobility (0.75âeV), but such migration would result in the defect being more strongly localized below the surface56. The mechanism of the mobility of electrons and protons describes the experimentally observed spillover on titanium oxide (Fig. 3). On aluminium oxide30, hydrogen adsorption from the gas phase and dissociation are strongly affected by the presence of co-adsorbed water molecules on the oxide surface, with Eact ranging from 0.63âeV (dry surface) to 0.99âeV (fully hydrated surface) (Extended Data Fig. 10b). Since water plays an essential role in the stability and reactivity of aluminium oxide28, 30, we studied both a hydrated and a dry surface to achieve understanding of the observed distance-dependent mobility of hydrogen atoms on aluminium oxide.In the ab initio thermodynamics calculation details, for a given pair of temperature and pressure values (T, p), the most stable surface composition and geometry is the one that minimizes the system free energy 																											:where A is surface area, Etot is the total energy, p0 is standard pressure (1 bar), H is enthalpy, S is entropy and Î¼i(T, p) is the chemical potential of species i, at given temperature and pressure. The parameter Î¼i(T, p) includes the vibrational, rotational and ideal gas entropy contributions to the chemical potential of the species i. The computed values for hydrogen Î¼H(T, p0) at the given temperatures are: â0.03âeV (at 50âK); â0.08âeV (at 100âK); â0.14âeV (150âK); â0.20âeV (at 200âK); â0.26 (at 250âK); â0.33âeV (at 300âK); â0.41âeV (at 350âK); â0.48âeV (at 400âK); â0.56âeV (at 450âK); â0.63âeV (at 500âK); â0.71âeV (at 550âK); â0.79âeV (at 600âK); â0.88âeV (at 650âK); â0.96âeV (at 700âK); â1.04âeV (at 750âK); â1.13âeV (at 800âK) and â1.21âeV (at 850âK).Diffusion on a surface depends not only on the activation energy for the movement of an atom on a surface but also on the availability of neighbouring sites and on the temperature of the system. The mobility of a surface adsorbed atom is therefore better represented by the diffusion coefficient, D.A first approach to the problem of surface diffusion is the random walk model proposed by A. Einstein57. It involves modelling the motion of individual particles as random walks in the same way as the motions of gas molecules are modelled. According to the random walk model for diffusion, the macroscopic surface diffusion coefficient D for an atom (or molecule) on a two-dimensional surface can be computed by the following expression58:where 																											 is the mean square displacement at time t, a is the distance travelled by the atom in a single hop (the spacing between adsorption sites), and Î½ is the microscopic jump frequency. z is the number of neighbouring sites to which the atom can hop. For one-dimensional diffusion, that is, when the atom can hop either to the left or to the right neighbouring site, as is the case for titanium oxide and Î³-aluminium oxide, zâ=â2.The harmonic transition state theory model relates the microscopic jump frequency to the activation energy Eact for surface diffusion and to the temperature, as shown in the following expression:where Î½0 is the attempt frequency required to overcome the activation energy barrier, T is temperature and k is Boltzmannâs constant.The harmonic transition state theory model is a good approximation for many solid-state and surface reactions, because the energy barriers are often large compared to the average kinetic energy in the system, kT. This is important because it ensures that the system reaches a local equilibrium between reactive events. Î½0 can be obtained by considering the nature of the state where the atom is between the lattice sites (saddle point).NEB optimization was performed in such a way that one of the images converges to a saddle point (as opposed to all the images being evenly spaced along the reaction coordinate). This is called climbing-image NEB; an optimized climbing-image NEB has a saddle point as its highest energy image48. The attempt frequency will be given by the frequency at which the atom in the saddle point will vibrate along the reaction path and can be computed by:where N is the total number of atoms, and 																											 and 																											 are the normal mode frequencies at the reactant and saddle point. There is exactly one imaginary frequency at the saddle point, giving the index 																											.The activation energy Eact is defined as the difference in energy between the saddle and reactant energy. The exponential term represents the Boltzmann probability that a vibrational along the reaction direction will overcome the barrier and continue into the product state.For hydrogen diffusion on titanium oxide, the computed value of the attempt frequency is 3,646âcmâ1, the activation energy barrier is 0.73âeV (independent of water coverage) and the diffusion coefficient at 300âK is 4.15âÃâ10â14âcm2 sâ1. For hydrogen diffusion on aluminium oxide, the respective values are 1,938âcmâ1, 1.32âeV (intermediate water coverage) and 1.39âÃâ10â23âcm2 sâ1.The data that support the findings of this study are available from the authors on reasonable request.Download referencesPart of this work was performed at the Swiss Light Source, Paul Scherrer Institute, Switzerland.

The iron oxide particles (red) have a diameter of 60ânm while the platinum particles (green) have a diameter of 30ânm. The distance between the dimeric pairs is 1âÎ¼m. b, SEM image of the nanofabricated model system on titanium oxide support (5ânm thick) which is an exact one-to-one rendition of the design (500ânm scale bar). c, Scheme of different stages of overlaid EBL to fabricate the model system (details in Methods).Fe L3 edge XAS spectra of the iron nanoparticles at room temperature in pair âa1â (overlapping pair), pair âc2â (just touching each other), pair âd3â (45ânm distance) and system âd4â, which has no platinum in its vicinity. All the iron nanoparticles have the same initial state, which is the native oxide, formed by exposure of iron particles in air after nanofabrication. Iron oxidation occurs through initial formation of iron(II) oxide followed by progressive transformation to iron(II,III) oxide. A small amount of iron(II) oxide remains owing to its limited oxidation at the interface14, 36. The XAS spectrum of the native oxide state shows a resonance peak and a shoulder. With reduction of the iron oxide, the peak resonance starts to decrease and the shoulder peak intensity increases14.The fits are extracted using linear combination fitting of the experimental XAS spectra with the reference of metallic iron(0), iron(II) oxide, iron(II,III) oxide, and iron(III) oxide14, 36. The Fe L3 edge XAS spectra in Fig. 2a shows higher reduction for the iron oxide particles at distances less than 15ânm from the platinum particles, that is, in pairs âa1â to âc4â. The initial state was iron(II,III) oxide and iron (II) oxide (Extended Data Fig. 2). During reduction, the fraction of iron(II,III) oxide decreases and that of iron (II) oxide increases. A decrease in the fraction of iron(II) oxide on further reduction results in the evolution of metallic iron(0). The pair with overlapping iron oxide and platinum particles (pair âa1â) is most reduced, producing 16.8% of iron(0). The extent of reduction decreases as the distance between the particles increases in each following pair. The iron oxide particle in pair âc4â (with an interparticle distance of 15ânm) has 1.2% of iron(0) and the iron oxide particles in pairs âd1â, âd2â and âd3â and system âd4â, at distances more than 15ânm from their corresponding platinum particles, have no iron(0). This shows the gradient of reduction depending on the distance from the platinum catalyst up to 15ânm.a, Al K edge XAS spectra of the aluminium oxide support at around 300âK and 10â10âmbar without hydrogen. The absorption edge observed in the measured spectra at 1,566âeV and the characteristic broad peak at about 20âeV indicate a dominant tetrahedral aluminium coordination. An increase in intensity in the range 1,567â1,575âeV is visible, along with the lower white line intensity and the lower intensity of the broad peak at 1,583âeV compared to purely tetrahedral aluminium coordination: this is indicative of a small amount of octahedrally coordinated aluminium at the cost of tetrahedrally coordinated aluminium34. The visible pre-edge feature is characteristic of three-coordinated aluminium sites (Al3c)27, which confirms their existence under the experimental conditions. At higher water coverage, these Al3c sites are known to be unavailable28, which will lead to the disappearance of this pre-edge feature. b, Calculated thermodynamic diagram showing that the availability of Al3c sites depends on the partial pressure of water 																											 in the system. Coloured areas indicate the percentage of free Al sites on the surface for a given value of temperature and 																											.Fe L3 edge XAS spectra of the single iron oxide particle on the titanium oxide support, without any platinum (particle âd4â in Extended Fig. 1a) compared with the overlapping pair (pair âa1â) and the pair with interparticle distance 45ânm (pair âd3â) at different stages of reduction: a, Initial state at room temperature; b, at 343âK; and c, at 353âK. All the iron oxide particles are equally reduced irrespective of the distance from platinum.Fits are extracted using linear combination fitting of the experimental XAS spectra with the reference of metallic iron(0), iron (II) oxide, iron(II,III) oxide, and iron(III) oxide14, 36. The XAS spectra of all 16 iron oxide nanoparticles on titanium oxide coincide at all temperatures (Extended Data Fig. 5). The ironâiron oxide coreâshell particles have multilayered scales of iron(0), iron (II) oxide, iron(II,III) oxide and iron(III) oxide at the native oxide stage at 298âK. With hydrogen dosage of 1âÃâ10â5âmbar, the particles start to reduce as temperature is increased leading to interconversion of oxides and evolution of a metallic iron core. Initial reduction of the outermost shells of iron(III) oxide and iron(II,III) oxide leads to an increase in concentration of iron(II) oxide, some of which reduces to metallic iron. The concentration of metallic iron, signifying the extent of reduction at each stage, increases further as iron(II) oxide reduces and the iron(III) oxide is negligible. 17% of iron(0) is seen at 343âK for all iron particles, which increases to 33.6% at 353âK as the particles reduce further.Spectra are taken at each of the pairs, at the lone iron oxide particle and in an isolated area on the surface at least 1âÎ¼m from any platinum or iron oxide particles at different temperatures: a, 300âK; b, 323âK; c, 343âK; and d, 353âK. Reduction of titanium oxide occurs uniformly all over the surface, irrespective of the distance from platinum. The rapid diffusion of H atoms results in a range much larger than 1âÎ¼m for the reduction of the surface.a, The most stable hydrogen coverage of a Pt13 cluster supported on anatase, as a function of temperature and partial hydrogen pressure 																											.

The average number of hydrogen atoms per Pt cluster is indicated by coloured lines. They are indicative only, because of the multitude of possible hydrogen and platinum configurations.

The parameters in the model were evaluated based on the available experimental data and first-principle calculations. The composition-elastic properties of the full compositions were predicted and the results were in good agreement with the experimental data. It is found that the Î² phase can be divided into two regions which are separated by a critical dynamical stability composition line. The corresponding valence electron number per atom and the polycrystalline Young×³s modulus of the critical compositions are 4.04â4.17 and 30â40 GPa respectively. Orientation dependencies of single-crystal Young×³s modulus show strong elastic anisotropy on the Ti-rich side. Alloys compositions with a Young×³s modulus along the <100> direction matching that of bone were found. The current results present an effective strategy for designing low modulus biomedical alloys using computational modeling.Single-crystal elastic constants of the bcc solution phase in the TiâNbâZr system are modeled using CALPHAD method. Orientation dependencies of single-crystal Youngâs modulus are analyzed based on optimized model parameters. Compositions with Youngâs modulus along the <100> direction matching that of bone are predicted.Orthopedic implants made from alloys with a high Young×³s modulus compared to that of bone (10â30 GPa), tend to fail after long-term use due to the so-called stress shielding effect, which âshieldsâ tissues surrounding the implant from stress and may finally lead to disintegration (Niinomi et al., 2012 and Sumner et al., 2001). To minimize this detrimental effect, Î²-type (bcc structure) titanium alloys with good biocompatibility and excellent mechanical properties, i.e. high strength and low Young×³s modulus, have been extensively investigated in the recent past. For example, Tiâ29Nbâ13Taâ4.6Zr (TNTZ) (Tane et al., 2008), Tiâ24Nbâ4Zrâ7.9Sn (Hao et al., 2007) and gum metals (Saito et al., 2003) with Young×³s modulus as low as 42â62 GPa have been developed.In order to further decrease the intrinsic Young×³s modulus of Î² titanium alloys, various technologies have been used to provide theoretical guidance for the selection of alloying elements and composition design. Kuroda et al. (1998) have developed a general approach to predict the Î² and non-Î² boundary of Ti-alloys using two alloying parameters, namely the average covalent bond strength (Bo) and average d orbital energy level (Md). In the BoâMd diagram, titanium alloys can be divided into Î±, Î± + Î² and Î² three regions and the low elastic modulus can be achieved by increasing Bo and Md values in the Î²-phase region. The e/a (valence electron number per atom) value is another criterion to determine the tetragonal shear elastic constant Câ², which can be used to represent the dynamical stability of a cubic crystal ( Ikehata et al., 2004). However, the quantitative relationships between Young×³s modulus, Bo, Md and e/a have not yet been clarified. In fact, in order to get a comprehensive understanding of the elastic properties of a given structure, single-crystal elastic constants are needed. Various elastic properties can be directly calculated using elastic constants based on average or mesoscale methods (Friak et al., 2011). However, only a few studies have been reported concerning the single crystalline materials for biomedical applications ( Takesue et al., 2009 and Tane et al., 2010), because the preparation of single crystal specimens is very difficult or even impossible. Other reported single-crystal elastic constants data were estimated by first-principle (FP) calculations ( Ikehata et al., 2004 and Ma et al., 2008) carried out at 0 K for low order system. Therefore, on the one hand, a huge number of experiments are being carried out to develop Î²-type Ti-alloys with Young×³s modulus lower than 30 GPa; on the other hand, the theoretical inspection of elastic properties on Î² phase remains unclear, especially, (1) What is the Young×³s modulus limit of a given Î² phase (e.g. TiâNbâZr based). (2) How to determine the âcandidate compositionsâ for further investigation.Those questions outlined above are the motivation of applying CALPHAD (Calculation of Phase Diagram) method to model elastic constants in the present study. CALPHAD has proved to be an effective method to model the properties of high order systems (Kaufman and Bernstein, 1970). The phenomenology of the CALPHAD method is that the properties of individual phase can be modeled by a mechanical mixing term of individual species plus an interaction term among the species. Traditionally, the CALPHAD method was developed to model thermodynamic properties (Kumar et al., 1994), but its general form has made it successfully extend to the modeling of other properties that are independent of thermodynamics, such as atomic mobility (Ãgren, 1982), molar volume (Lu et al., 2005), thermal expansion coefficient, thermal conductivity (Gheribi and Chartrand, 2012) and single-crystal elastic constants (Liu et al., 2010). In our previous work (Wang et al., 2015), the CALPHAD model parameters of ZrâNb binary system have been evaluated. The composition-polycrystalline elastic properties of the ZrâNb alloys of full compositions were predicted and showed good agreement with the experimental data.In the present work, we use the CALPHAD method to describe single-crystal elastic constants in the TiâNbâZr ternary system. The model parameters are evaluated based on the available experimental data and first-principle calculations. Then, polycrystalline elastic properties of full compositions are predicted. Furthermore, in order to design biomedical materials with a low Young×³s modulus matching that one of bone, the limit and orientation dependencies of Young×³s modulus are also discussed.For the bcc structure, low Young×³s modulus can be achieved by a small tetragonal shear elastic constant Câ², but the structure become dynamical unstable when Câ² becomes negative. With the single-crystal elastic constants, Câ² can be calculated. As shown in  Fig. 4, one can clearly distinguish two regions for bcc TiâNbâZr alloys: dynamically stable and unstable compositions, which are separated by the critical compositions at which Câ² become zero (red dashed line). The corresponding valence electron number per atom on the red line is about 4.04â4.17, which is smaller than 4.20â4.24 firstly reported by  Ikehata et al. (2004) using first principle calculations. In the present work, Câ² is predicted to be 10.3 GPa instead of zero when e/a is 4.24, which is consistent with the experimental value 12.5â13.5 GPa reported by Takesue Takesue et al. (2009) for the single-crystal Gum Metal. Our predictions are closer to experiment results because both temperature and disorder effects are considered in the present wok. In Figs. 3 and 4, it is worth noting that for compositions with the same e/a can have different tetragonal shear elastic constant Câ²values and consequently different phase stability. In return, shear elastic constant Câ² is zero on the critic compositions line, while the corresponding e/a values change from 4.04 to 4.17 nonlinearly. Therefore, the present work shows that e/a is not a good indicator to describe and predict the phase stability. Predicted composition-polycrystalline Young×³s modulus of the TiâNbâZr at the critic compositions line is shown in Fig. 5. It can be seen that even at the critical compositions corresponding to the dynamical stabilization of bcc TiâNbâZr alloys, the polycrystalline Young×³s modulus (30â40 GPa) is still larger than that of bone (10â30 GPa). Therefore, it is impossible to further decrease the Young×³s modulus of bcc TiâNbâZr based polycrystalline alloys to match that of bone.Predicted composition-Young×³s modulus profiles of the TiâNbâZr at critical compositions line.A possible alternative way to design promising candidates for biomedical implants from the TiâNbâZr system is using single crystals whose special direction with the lowest Young×³s modulus is oriented along a loading direction in human bones, as reported by Tane et al. (2008). With the above single-crystal elastic constants, three-dimensional single-crystal Young×³s modulus in all directions can be predicted. Fig. 6 shows that the orientation dependence of the Young×³s modulus and the shear modulus for Tiâ20Nbâ10Zr (at%), Tiâ50Nbâ10Zr (at%), and Tiâ80Nbâ10Zr (at%) single crystals. It can be seen that the elastic anisotropy first decreases with increasing Nb content, becoming nearly isotropic at 50 at% Nb and then increases with further increasing Nb content. The direction of the minimum Young×³s modulus changes from <100> to <111> with increasing Nb content.Orientation dependence of single-crystal Young×³s modulus and shear modulus in Tiâ20Nbâ10Zr, Tiâ50Nbâ10Zr, and Tiâ80Nbâ10Zr single crystals.For Gum Metal with the composition near Tiâ36Nbâ2Taâ3Zrâ0.3 O (wt%), the variation of E[hkl] with respect to the [hkl] direction on the plane is given in Fig. 7. The direction is denoted by Î¸, which is the angle from the <100> direction on the <110> zone axis. The three Young×³s modulus along the [100], [110] and [111] directions measured by Naohisa ( Friak et al., 2011) on single-crystals are also marked in the figure by circles. The predicted results agree with the experimental data within the error bar. Recently, the full components of single crystal elastic constants of solution-treated Gum Metal are measured to be 134.5 GPa for C11, 106.5 GPa for C12 and 34.1 GPa for C44 by Tane et al. (2011) at room temperature. The elastic constants predicted to be 132.2 GPa for C11, 111.8 GPa for C12 and 34.9 GPa for C44 by our modeling. It can be clearly seen that a very good agreement with the experimental data has been achieved.Single-crystal Young×³s modulus with respect to the [h k l] direction on the plane compared with experimental data.As seen in Fig. 8, <100> shows the lowest Young×³s modulus for Ti-rich compositions. In order to find compositions with a Young×³s modulus along <100> matching that of the bone, the composition-E[100] of full compositions at room temperature are calculated as shown in Fig. 8. The region with E[100] between 10 and 30 GPa is highlighted with the label âcandidate compositionsâ. Since the lowest Nb content of the âcandidate compositionsâ is larger than that of the critical compositions line, the âcandidate compositionsâ belongs to the dynamical stable regions. Yet, the Ï phase with high Young×³s modulus may appear in these low Nb concentrations, but it is possible to avoid that by adding other elements, such as Sn in the Ti2448 alloys ( Hao et al., 2007).Predicted composition-Young×³s modulus along <100> direction of the TiâNbâZr.In order to apply such single-crystal elastic constants modeling for the development of biomedical titanium alloys, a great deal of further work is needed. Firstly, a multicomponent elastic constant databases must be established, including the commonly used elements like Nb, Zr, Ta, Mo, Sn and O. Secondly, CALPHAD model is more or less an empirical equation rather than a physical based model, therefore, for phases that have a particular physical or chemical feature (like magnetism and ordering), special models should be developed in order to be described accurately. Thirdly, beyond the average method, continuum approaches (e.g. FEM, phase field) (Friak et al., 2011) should be used to simulate more complex macrostructures.Single-crystal elastic constants of bcc solution phases in TiâNbâZr ternary system are modeled with CALPHAD methods. Both single-crystal and polycrystalline elastic properties of full compositions at room temperature are predicted and analyzed based on the elastic parameters. The following conclusions are obtained:Î² TiâNbâZr alloys can be divided into two regions: dynamically stable and unstable compositions. The corresponding valence electron number per atom on the critical compositions is about 4.04â4.17.The limit of the polycrystalline Young×³s modulus is found to be 30â40 GPa, which is still larger than that of bone.Single crystal Young×³s modulus has a strong elastic anisotropy for Ti-rich compositions. Alloys with a Young×³s modulus along the <100> direction matching that of bone are found.CALPHAD methods can be used to develop the database of single-crystal elastic constants, which could accelerate the discovery/development of low-modulus biomedical alloys.This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 51371200), National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) (Grant no. 2014CB644000).Numerical treatment of diffusional reactions in multicomponent alloysJ.

All rights reserved.Oxidative transformations of alcohols represent an important class of reactions for a number of industries,(1) and the growth of ethanol as a biorenewable fuel/feedstock offers the potential to significantly deepen the effect of such conversion processes. Industrial techniques for selectively oxidizing alcohols commonly use transition-metal oxides as stoichiometric reagents.(2) These methods suffer from significant drawbacks, as they are expensive and generate environmentally hazardous waste products. The development of a catalyst for selective alcohol oxidation would provide a more environmentally friendly and sustainable means of carrying out these transformations.A number of transition metals catalyze selective alcohol oxidation.(1, 3, 4) Gold catalysts in particular display promising behavior for these reactions, demonstrating the capacity to selectively oxidize a diverse array of alcohols(5, 6) and the ability to do so with higher selectivity than other commonly studied metal catalysts.(7-10) Gold-catalyzed selective alcohol oxidation was first demonstrated by Prati and Rossi, who showed that gold supported on activated carbon displayed high activity and exceptional selectivity for the oxidation of vicinal diols to Î±-hydroxy carboxylates.(7) Gold catalysts are also capable of promoting the oxidative dehydrogenation of primary and secondary alcohols in the gas phase, resulting in the production of aldehydes and ketones, respectively.(11) Several studies from Friend et al. have shown that nanoporous gold catalysts promote the gas-phase esterification of simple alcohols,(12-15) and Zheng and Stucky demonstrated that dehydrogenation and esterification can each occur during the gas-phase oxidation of ethanol over an Au/SiO2 catalyst.(16)In the condensed phase, gold catalysts can promote oxidation of alcohols to carboxylic acids(10, 17) and to esters.(6, 17) Gold catalysts supported on several types of metal oxides(3, 18) and on activated carbon(19) have been shown to promote alcohol oxidation under these conditions, and even unsupported gold nanoparticles(20) and bulk gold powder(19) exhibit alcohol oxidation activity under the proper conditions. Most of these catalysts require the presence of a base for catalytic activity to be promoted, rapidly deactivating under neutral or acidic conditions.(21, 22) Gold supported on ceria nanoparticles (Au/CeO2), however, demonstrates the ability to facilitate oxidation reactions in neat alcohol without added base.(6) This behavior is likely associated with the unique redox behavior of ceria,(23) and previous studies have suggested that the ceria surface participates in the alcohol oxidation process as a cocatalyst.(6, 9)The aqueous-phase oxidation of aliphatic alcohols over gold catalysts generally results in the production of carboxylic acid derivatives in high yields,(10, 17, 24) while reactions conducted in neat or mixed alcohol phases tend to generate esters.(6, 17) Rautiainen et al. showed that benzaldehyde, benzoic acid, and methyl benzoate could each be generated via the oxidation of benzyl alcohol over an Au/Al2O3 catalyst with the product distribution dictated by the choice of solvent.(25) The Au/CeO2 catalyst discussed above also exhibited variations in selectivity when the alcohol oxidation reactions were conducted in different phases.(6) Esters were the predominant products observed in neat alcohol, while carboxylic acids were generated when the reactions were carried out in basic aqueous media. The oxidative dehydrogenation process, which results in the production of an aldehyde, has been proposed to be an intermediate step for reaction pathways involving the synthesis of carboxylic acids and esters in condensed-phase studies,(6, 17) with removal of hydrogen from the CH bond identified as the rate-determining step of this process.(17, 26) Carboxylic acids are produced through subsequent oxidation of the aldehyde intermediate via the formation and dehydrogenation of geminal diol intermediates.(24) Ester formation proceeds through the generation and subsequent dehydration of a hemiacetal intermediate(6, 27) or through the condensation of a carboxylic acid with another alcohol. In the gas phase, the generation of esters via oxidation of alcohols over nanoporous gold catalysts has also been proposed to proceed through the formation of an aldehyde intermediate.(14, 15, 28, 29) Surface science techniques have been leveraged to conduct detailed molecular level studies of alcohol esterification on model gold surfaces and have provided evidence in support of this mechanism.(30-33) Although significant gaps exist with respect to the materials and conditions employed, the results obtained from surface science studies of alcohol oxidation on gold display very good agreement with those observed in the gas-phase alcohol oxidation studies conducted at atmospheric pressure.(33, 34)Many of the investigations of alcohol oxidation with condensed-phase systems discussed above used water as the reaction medium. Water is also the byproduct of alcohol oxidation reactions and is, therefore, always present in the reaction system at some concentration. Water has previously been shown to have significant effects on the behavior of gold catalysts.(22, 35) Minute quantities of water vapor can enhance the activity of gold catalysts for carbon monoxide oxidation by orders of magnitude relative to dry conditions.(36, 37) Water also plays a role in several other gold-catalyzed reactions, including propene epoxidation(38, 39) and reduction of nitric oxide with propene.(40)Previous studies have probed the role of water in gold-catalyzed alcohol oxidation reactions. Incorporating water into the reactant liquor induced a 7-fold enhancement of the activity for oxidative dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde over an Au/TiO2 catalyst,(41) which was suggested to result in part from water-assisted activation of O2 on the catalyst surface. Additional support for this mechanism has been provided by density functional theory (DFT) studies. Chang et al. conducted a DFT investigation of methanol dehydrogenation on the Au(111) surface and showed that water lowers the energy barrier for formation of a hydroperoxyl intermediate (the proposed rate-determining step for the reaction) by a factor of 2.(42) Similarly, Shang et al. showed that solvation effects induced by water bring about a dramatic enhancement in the adsorption energy of O2 on gold nanoclusters.(43)Water has also been suggested to play a more direct role in some gold-catalyzed alcohol oxidation processes. Using mass spectroscopy in conjunction with isotope labeling experiments during ethanol and glycerol oxidation, Zope et al. showed that oxygen from O2 was not incorporated into the reaction products (acetic acid and glyceric acid, respectively).(24) When these reactions were conducted in H216O and 18O2 was used as the oxidant species, the carboxylic acid products contained only 16O and did not incorporate the isotopic oxygen from O2. Previous work from our research group investigating the oxidation of allylic alcohols on model gold surfaces provided evidence that hydroxyl species can also participate directly in the dehydrogenation reaction(44) and can influence the selectivity displayed toward other oxidative processes promoted on the surface.(45)In this study, we investigated the effects of water on the behavior of a ceria-supported gold catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation and esterification of ethanol using a fixed-bed flow reactor system. The exceptional alcohol oxidation activity exhibited by Au/CeO2 and the selectivity variations demonstrated when carrying out the alcohol oxidation reactions in neat alcohol versus those in the aqueous phase made this system ideal for studying the influence of water on these processes. The Au/CeO2 catalyst promoted both reactions under the conditions tested. Including water in the reactant feed shifted the overall activity and selectivity displayed by the system. Water increased the rate of ethanol dehydrogenation but did not significantly influence the kinetics of this process, leaving the reaction orders largely unchanged. Significant changes to the ethanol reaction order for the esterification reaction were observed upon incorporating water in the feed. Additionally, a large primary kinetic isotope effect (KIE) for the esterification reaction was observed when the water or ethanol hydroxyl hydrogens were replaced with deuterium, suggesting that breaking an OH bond is associated with the rate-determining step for this process. These observations are consistent with ethyl acetate formation proceeding through the condensation of ethanol with acetate species on the ceria support surface, a mechanism which is further supported by attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy and residual gas analysis tests. Our results provide new insights into the many roles that water can play in gold-catalyzed oxidation reactions and demonstrate that water can influence both the activity and the selectivity of oxidation processes.The ceria support material was prepared via a urea coprecipitationâgelation method similar to that employed by Li et al.(46) A solution of 0.11 M ammonium cerium nitrate and 2.0 M urea in deionized water was first prepared. This solution was then transferred to a round-bottom flask and heated to 100 Â°C with vigorous stirring. A light yellow precipitate was formed after â¼1 h, at which point the solution was diluted by â¼50% with deionized water. The resulting mixture was aged at 100 Â°C for 8 h. After it was cooled to room temperature, the mixture was centrifuged, and the supernatant was discarded. The remaining solids were washed by resuspending three times in deionized water. The product, a light yellow powder, was dried for â¼24 h under vacuum at room temperature and then calcined at 400 Â°C for 4 h.The goldâceria catalyst employed in this study was synthesized via the depositionâprecipitation with urea technique developed by Zanella et al.(47) A solution of 6.1 Ã 10â3 M HAuCl4 and 0.42 M urea in deionized water was prepared. The ceria support was suspended in this solution with vigorous stirring in a quantity sufficient to produce a 5 wt % Au catalyst at full gold incorporation. This mixture was aged at 80 Â°C for 16 h to deposit gold onto the ceria surface. After deposition, the suspension was centrifuged, and the supernatant was discarded. The catalyst was washed by re-suspending three times in deionized water. A residual chloride test conducted on the supernatant after the third wash confirmed that this procedure was sufficient to remove chloride ions from the material. The product was dried for â¼24 h under vacuum at room temperature. The resulting solid material was crushed and sieved to between 200 and 500 Î¼m and stored in a dark refrigerator until use.BET surface area analysis was performed with a Quantachrome Instruments NOVA 2000 high-speed surface area BET analyzer at a temperature of 77 K. Before N2 physisorption, the sample was degassed at 100 Â°C overnight in a vacuum oven. The data was analyzed with the Quantachrome Autosorb1 software, using multipoint BET analysis at P/P0 = 0.1â0.3. The correlation coefficient achieved was greater than 0.9999.X-ray diffraction (XRD) was conducted with a Rigaku R-AXIS SPIDER diffractometer equipped with a Cu sealed-tube source and an image plate detector. Spectra were collected with radiation from a Cu KÎ± X-ray source operated at 40 kV and 40 mA. The sample was rotated at 10Â°/s during X-ray exposure.An Agilent 7500ce spectrometer was used to analyze the mass density of gold incorporated into the catalyst sample via inductively coupled plasmaâmass spectrometry (ICP-MS). A 10 mg sample of Au/CeO2 was digested in 6 mL of concentrated HCl/30% H2O2 solution in a 2/1 mixture. This sample was diluted with 1% HCl solution prior to analysis.A field emission JEOL 2010F high-resolution transmission electron microscope operated at 200 kV was used to obtain high angle annular dark field-scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images. An Oxford energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) instrument employing a SiLi detector was used for elemental analysis. A lacey carbon coated copper TEM grid was prepared by drop casting from a suspension of the catalyst sample prepared by sonicating a small amount of the material in ethanol. The TEM grid was placed in a vacuum oven and heated to 100 Â°C overnight to remove excess solvent prior to imaging.Catalytic activity for ethanol oxidation was studied in an ambient pressure fixed-bed flow reactor system. The catalyst bed, 90 mg of Au/CeO2 diluted with 900 mg of SiC (unless otherwise indicated), was held between two quartz wool plugs in a quartz tube with 7 mm i.d. The tube was supported in an Applied Test Systems Model 3210 tube furnace. MKS Type M100B mass flow controllers were used to deliver permanent gases to the reactor bed. A calibrated New Era Pump Systems syringe pump was employed to deliver deionized water into a heated section of tubing upstream from the reaction zone. Ethanol was introduced to the system by bubbling the reactant feed stream through a temperature-controlled liquidâvapor saturator. All gas lines downstream from the saturator and syringe pump were heated to maintain condensable species in the gas phase.Immediately prior to reaction testing, the catalyst was calcined in situ at 300 Â°C in 30 sccm of dry air flow for 1 h. Following this pretreatment, the catalyst bed was cooled to 80 Â°C, the reaction temperature for all experiments, under continued air flow. When the reaction temperature was reached, ethanol was introduced to the reactant stream and the air flow was adjusted to deliver a space velocity of 32000 hâ1 across the catalyst bed. This space velocity was used for all experiments. The ethanol partial pressure in the feed stream was adjusted by changing the temperature of a cooling bath in thermal contact with the ethanol saturator. The O2 partial pressure was adjusted by diluting the air stream with a stream of pure N2. The reactor was held for several hours under each condition tested to ensure a steady state had been reached. These conditions were chosen such that ethanol conversions were <10% for all tests conducted in order to ensure that the system was operating in a differential conversion regime.Quantitative analysis of the reactor effluent was conducted with a HP 5890 Series II gas chromatograph (GC). Separation of components within the GC was achieved with a stainless steel column packed with Chromosorb 101 as the stationary phase. Both a flame ionization detector and a thermal conductivity detector were used to analyze the column effluent. An additional liquidâvapor saturator was used to deliver propanol, which was used as an internal standard, to the reactor effluent prior to injection into the GC. Carbon balances were calculated to be within 5% of unity for all experiments discussed in this study. Acetaldehyde and ethyl acetate turnover frequency (TOF) values were calculated by normalizing the production rate for each species by the total number of surface gold atoms present in the catalyst bed, which was estimated using the average particle size from TEM image analysis and the specific gold content determined via ICP-MS. The gold particles were assumed to be hemispherical.ATR-IR spectra were collected with a Thermo Nicolet Nexus 470 spectrometer equipped with a Nicolet SMART Golden Gate ATR, a diamond crystal with KRS-5 focusing element, and a DTGS detector. Spectra were collected using a resolution of 4 cmâ1. Post-reaction samples were analyzed after allowing the ethanol oxidation process to reach a steady state. The samples were then quenched to room temperature under continued reactant flow and stored in a glass vial until testing. Control samples were prepared by adding drops of acetic acid, ethyl acetate, or a NaOH solution in ethanol to â¼30 mg of the CeO2 support. Samples were then heated to 100 Â°C for 8 h and stored in glass vials until testing.RGA of the reactor effluent was conducted with an online mass spectrometer using a custom-built gas analysis system consisting of an ExTorr XT100 Residual Gas Analyzer operating in a stainless steel chamber maintained at a base pressure of â¼1 Ã 10â9 Torr. Gas from the reactor effluent was introduced to this chamber at a pressure of 1.0 Ã 10â6 Torr via a temperature-controlled leak valve sampling system. This system allowed time-resolved analysis of the reactor effluent gas composition to be conducted.XRD spectra of the as-synthesized ceria support material and the Au/CeO2 catalyst after calcination at 300 Â°C are shown in Figure 1. All features displayed in both spectra correspond to the cubic fluorite phase of CeO2 (JCPDS 34-0394), indicating that the urea coprecipitationâgelation method used to synthesize the support resulted in the production of phase-pure CeO2, and no gold peaks were detected in the spectrum for the Au/CeO2 sample, indicating highly disperse Au nanoparticles. The specific surface areas determined by BET analysis for the CeO2 support material and the Au/CeO2 catalyst after the calcination pretreatment were 77 and 87 m2/g, respectively; the gold content in the Au/CeO2 catalyst was determined to be 2.5 wt % by ICP-MS analysis.A representative HAADF-STEM image of the Au/CeO2 catalyst after calcination is shown in Figure 2a. Gold particles in this image appear brighter than ceria due to differences in the Z contrast between these two materials. We confirmed our ability to distinguish between gold and ceria via EDS mapping analysis, images from which are included in the Supporting Information. From the image shown in Figure 2a, it is apparent that both the gold and the ceria in the catalyst were present in the material as nanoparticles. A histogram displaying the gold particle size distribution for the catalyst is shown in Figure 2b. More than 100 unique particles were measured to generate this histogram. The average size of the gold particles was calculated to be 3.5 Â± 1.4 nm.The Au/CeO2 catalyst was capable of promoting the oxidative dehydrogenation and esterification of ethanol in a stream of 3.5 kPa of ethanol with a balance of air. Under these conditions, ethanol dehydrogenation was the dominant process, and acetaldehyde was generated with a TOF of 85 hâ1 (per surface gold atom). Ethanol esterification, resulting in the production of ethyl acetate, was 1 order of magnitude slower, with an observed TOF of 9 hâ1. No other products were generated at detectable levels under these conditions. Zheng and Stucky(16) as well as Kosuda et al.(28) also observed acetaldehyde and ethyl acetate as the predominant products of the gas-phase oxidation of ethanol with Au/SiO2 and nanoporous gold catalysts, respectively, operating under conditions similar to those we have studied.We investigated the influence of water on these ethanol oxidation reactions by introducing various partial pressures of water to the reactor feed stream. Results from these experiments are shown in Figure 3. The feed stream consisted of the specified pressure of water and 3.5 kPa of ethanol with a balance of air for these reaction tests.Incorporating water into the reactor feed stream induced changes in the overall reaction selectivity. The activity for acetaldehyde production, the primary oxidation process, increased by â¼10%, shifting from 85 hâ1 under dry conditions to 95 hâ1 when 2 kPa of water was incorporated in the feed. As the water content was increased further, the acetaldehyde production rate decreased, measuring 82 hâ1 at 10 kPa of water, slightly below the rate observed under dry conditions. Ethyl acetate production was inhibited at all water concentrations tested, shifting from 9.0 hâ1 under dry conditions to 6.8 hâ1 at a water pressure of 10 kPa (â¼25% reduction in rate).Water is a byproduct of both ethanol oxidation reactions; therefore, even with a dry reactor feed, the catalyst was still exposed to â¼0.1â0.3 kPa water generated in situ. We were unable to design an experiment in which water was completely removed from the reactor system, but we were able to mitigate the exposure of the catalyst to water produced in situ by using molecular sieve type 3A as the diluent material in place of SiC. This molecular sieve has pores that are 3 Ã wide, allowing it to absorb water, which has a kinetic diameter <3 Ã, but not to take up the other reactant or product species, which all have diameters >3 Ã. On dilution with molecular sieve instead of SiC, the activity for acetaldehyde production decreased by 6% to 80 hâ1, while the activity for ethyl acetate production was not significantly changed.To more rigorously study the effects of water on the ethanol dehydrogenation reaction, we determined the O2 and ethanol reaction orders for each process using dry reactant feeds and feeds containing 5 kPa of water. logâlog plots used for the determination of ethanol and O2 reaction orders for acetaldehyde production are shown in Figure 4. The O2 partial pressure was fixed at 21 kPa for the ethanol reaction order tests, and the ethanol pressure was fixed at 1.5 kPa for the O2 reaction order tests. With a dry reactor feed, the ethanol reaction order for acetaldehyde production was measured to be 0.22 Â± 0.02. The inclusion of water in the feed did not affect the reaction order for this process, which we measured to be 0.24 Â± 0.01 in the presence of 5 kPa of water. Linear regression data from these analyses are included in the Supporting Information.A low O2 reaction order of 0.12 Â± 0.01 was measured for acetaldehyde production when a dry reactor feed was used. This value is in good agreement with observations made by Kosuda et al., who demonstrated a weak dependence of the acetaldehyde on O2 partial pressure during ethanol oxidation with a nanoporous gold catalyst.(28) Ethanol oxidation to acetaldehyde catalyzed by Au/MgAl2O4(10) and Au/TiO2(48) displayed low dependences on O2 partial pressure as well. Including 5 kPa of water in the reactor feed changed the O2 reaction order for acetaldehyde production, increasing the value from 0.12 Â± 0.01 to 0.20 Â± 0.02. This shift in O2 reaction order could signify a small change to the surface kinetics for the ethanol oxidation reactions; however, considering the low dependence measured for O2, this shift could also be an artifact of the log function, as the changes in reaction rates are relatively small and thus may not be significant.To further assess the role of water in the acetaldehyde production reaction, we performed ethanol oxidation with 5 kPa of D2O in the reactor feed in place of H2O to probe potential isotope effects. A small effect was observed for the initial oxidation to acetaldehyde production process, with a kH/kD value of 1.2, suggesting that an equilibrium isotope effect is at play. Studies of gold-catalyzed CO oxidation employing similar experiments also observed low KIE values in the range of 1.0â1.4,(49-51) all of which were attributed to equilibrium isotope effects. Our observed KIE for acetaldehyde production is consistent with these results.The oxidative dehydrogenation of alcohols over gold catalysts has frequently been suggested to proceed through the generation of alkoxide intermediates at Lewis acid sites on the catalyst surface, followed by cleavage of a CH bond associated with the alkoxideâs Î±-carbon via hydride transfer to the gold.(17, 26) A number of studies have suggested that the rate-determining step of this process is associated with cleavage of the CH bond, which has been substantiated by the observation of large KIE values upon deuterating the alcohol at the Î±-carbon position.(30, 52-55) Several surface science studies have suggested similar mechanisms for the oxidative dehydrogenation of many different types of alcohols.(44, 56, 57) The low reaction order in O2 suggests that oxygen activation is not kinetically important. Furthermore, DFT calculations from a recent study by Saavedra et al. indicate that water-assisted O2 activation is an extremely facile process,(51) suggesting that O2 activation is not likely to be associated with the rate-determining step of oxidative processes on gold catalysts when water is present. The observed behavior for ethanol oxidation on Au/CeO2 in this study is consistent with the previously proposed mechanisms of alkoxide formation on the catalyst surface and subsequent dehydrogenation catalyzed by gold.The role of water in this process could be similar to that previously shown for water-enhanced CO oxidation.(22, 35-37, 58) A number of potential mechanisms to explain the role of water in ethanol oxidation have been proposed, ranging from assisting in the activation of O2 to promoting the decomposition of reaction intermediates.(22, 35, 58) As studies have shown that hydride transfer from an adsorbed alkoxide to gold is likely the rate-determining step of this process,(6, 54) promoting activation of O2 would be unlikely to cause the observed change in the rate of this reaction, as oxidation of the AuâH species occurs after the rate-determining step. Rather, water likely plays a role in facilitating ethoxide formation on the catalyst surface when it is present at low coverages. Water may also help to prevent poisoning of the Au sites by adsorbed carboxylates,(59, 60) leaving greater availability for ethoxide adsorption near the Au nanoparticles.While enhancement effects were observed for acetaldehyde production, a decrease in ethyl acetate production occurred upon incorporating water in the reactor feed during the tests shown in Figure 3. These observations suggest that water plays a different role in each reaction. We performed kinetic analysis for the esterification process to study the effects of water on this reaction. logâlog plots used to determine the ethanol and O2 reaction orders for ethyl acetate production are shown in Figure 5. Again, the O2 partial pressure was fixed at 21 kPa for the ethanol reaction order experiments, and the ethanol pressure was fixed at 1.5 kPa for the O2 reaction order experiments. These data were collected in the same set of experiments as the acetaldehyde production tests shown in Figure 4. The ethanol reaction order for ethyl acetate production with a dry feed was determined to be 0.78 Â± 0.03, larger than that measured for acetaldehyde production, and water had a significant effect on the kinetics of this process, decreasing the reaction order in ethanol by a factor of 4 to 0.20 Â± 0.02.An O2 reaction order of 0.07 Â± 0.01 was measured for ethyl acetate production with a dry reactor feed, similar to that observed for acetaldehyde production and in agreement with observations from previous studies of gold catalysts, which showed a weak dependence of ethyl acetate production on O2 pressure.(10, 28, 48) The observed O2 reaction order for ethanol esterification increased upon incorporating water in the feed stream, shifting from 0.07 Â± 0.01 to 0.22 Â± 0.01. Again, this shift could also be an artifact of the log function and may not be significant but may also indicate small kinetic changes to the O2 activation process upon water incorporation.We note that acetaldehyde is a likely intermediate species in the ethanol esterification process, as suggested in several studies.(26, 31) The kinetics of ethyl acetate production should be influenced by changes to the acetaldehyde production rate, which would change the effective acetaldehyde concentration in the system. However, water did not significantly change the observed trends in reaction orders for acetaldehyde production, and acetaldehyde production increased by only 10% with added water. Ethyl acetate production, on the other hand, decreased at the lower added water contents; therefore, we can reasonably surmise that the changes observed in the ethyl acetate kinetics resulted from the presence of added water in the system and not from changes to the acetaldehyde concentration.We conducted thermodynamic analyses (included in the Supporting Information) to gauge the potential influence of equilibrium effects on the production of ethyl acetate and acetaldehyde. Due to the low temperature employed and the exergonic nature of both the dehydrogenation and the esterification process, the reactions were far from their equilibrium points for every set of conditions tested in this study.The kinetic isotope effect experiments described in the section above (1.5 kPa of ethanol, 5 kPa of H2O/D2O, balance air) had a much larger impact on ethyl acetate kinetics, as the kH/kD ratio was determined to be 2.0 Â± 0.1 under these conditions. This large kH/kD value is consistent with a primary KIE, suggesting that the rate-limiting step for esterification involves breaking an OâH bond. When this observation is coupled with the changes to the ethanol reaction order upon inclusion of water in the feed stream, it becomes clear that water plays a key role in directing the kinetics of the oxidative esterification reaction.Proton exchange among the OH groups of water, ethanol, and any hydroxyls on the support surface is a facile process. Therefore, the observed KIE could be associated with the reactivity of any of these species, rather than direct involvement of water in the reaction mechanism. Further, since water is a byproduct of both reactions, it is difficult to decouple the effects that result from the direct participation of water in mechanistic processes from the effects induced by other deuterated species in the system. As a further probe of this process, we determined kH/kD with d-ethanol as a function of the ethanol content in the reactor feed at a fixed water content (5 kPa of H2O/D2O). Results from these tests are shown in Figure 6.The measured kH/kD for the ethyl acetate production process decreased monotonically as the ethanol content in the reactor feed increased, shifting from 2.0 Â± 0.1 at an ethanol pressure of 1.5 kPa to 1.45 Â± 0.03 at an ethanol pressure of 4.8 kPa. As the ratio of ethanol to D2O increased, the fraction of deuterium atoms available for scrambling among water, ethanol, and the surface hydroxyls decreased. Therefore, we propose that the variation in kH/kD for ethyl acetate production was due to reduced amounts of deteurium available for the rate-determining step as the fraction of deuterated hydroxyls in the system was decreased.We also performed ethanol oxidation in the absence of added water using ethanol that was deuterated at the hydroxyl proton. When d-ethanol was fed to the reactor in the absence of added water (triangular data point in Figure 6), the KIE for ethyl acetate production increased to 3.04 Â± 0.05. These conditions led to the highest fraction of deuterium in the system, since during this test protons were only generated by the oxidation catalysis. Thus, the higher KIE measured in this experiment is likely more representative of the âtrueâ value. This indicates a primary KIE for esterification, suggesting that a proton transfer is rate-limiting. We also note that the measured kH/kD for the acetaldehyde production process varied only slightly in the range of 1.2â1.3 during all of these tests, in agreement with expected behavior for an equilibrium isotope effect.To probe the effects of water on the surface species present during the reaction, we performed post-reaction ATR-IR spectroscopy on the Au/CeO2 catalysts. Figure 7a shows IR spectra for the Au/CeO2 catalyst after ethanol oxidation with and without added water. The spectra are largely similar, with a band centered at 1535 cmâ1, a pair of overlapping bands at approximately 1440 and 1415 cmâ1, and a shoulder at about 1340 cmâ1. The only major difference between the two spectra is the broad band centered at about 1640 cmâ1, which we assign to the bending vibration of water adsorbed on the ceria support. There is notably little adsorbed water on the catalyst sample operated without additional water, indicating that the support is essentially completely covered with strongly adsorbed products of the reaction. This points to an important role of water, namely protecting the surface and metalâsupport interface sites from poisoning by carbonates and other reaction products, an effect that has previously been described for CO oxidation.(51, 59)To identify the adsorbed species, we deposited acetic acid, ethyl acetate, and sodium ethoxide (prepared from NaOH dissolved in ethanol) onto separate samples of the ceria support. Spectra obtained for each sample in the region from 1750 to 1150 cmâ1 are shown in Figure 7b. All of the spectra were similar to the spectra of the used catalysts, displaying similar features at 1535, 1440, 1415, and 1340 cmâ1; the only exception was the ethoxide spectrum, which did not have a discernible band at 1415 cmâ1. The observed bands are in good agreement with bands that have previously been assigned to Î½assym(OCO) stretches of acetate intermediates.(61-64)The formation of surface acetates during the ethanol oxidation reaction is not surprising. Surface carboxylates are known to be produced in gold-catalyzed oxidation reactions.(59) Acetates may play a role in the secondary oxidation of acetaldehyde to ethyl acetate, as the condensation of ethanol with the surface acetate would lead to ethyl acetate production. The similarity of the spectra for the samples treated with acetic acid and with ethyl acetate suggests either that (a) the IR spectra of the two species are too similar to differentiate the surface species or that (b) acetate species are formed upon the interaction of ethyl acetate with the ceria surface as well. This formation would require the reaction between hydroxyls/adsorbed water on the ceria surface and ethyl acetate in the reverse of the esterification process (saponification), generating a surface acetate and ethanol. Ethanol has been shown to interact with ceria surfaces to generate a surface hydroxyl and an alkoxide, but these intermediates are relatively unstable, recombining and desorbing below room temperature.(60) Between preparation of the samples and collection of the ATR-IR spectra, any ethanol that was generated would have evolved from the surface. However, acetates do not readily recombine with hydroxyls to desorb from ceria surfaces. Stubenrauch et al.(65) and Mullins et al.(66) each showed that acetates on CeO2(111) and CeO2(100) tended to interact strongly with the surfaces, remaining bound until decomposition at temperatures above 200 Â°C. These temperatures are far higher than the temperature at which we ran our experiments, which suggests that the acetates should remain on the surface after preparation (as we observed).To test the possibility of the condensation mechanism further, we exposed the ceria support material to ethyl acetate in a stream of argon while monitoring the production of ethanol in real time with an RGA system. Ethanol production can be monitored by measuring m/z 31, the largest mass fragment in the ethanol electronic ionization spectrum; however, this m/z value is also a small fragment observed in the ethyl acetate spectrum. To determine the proportion of the m/z 31 spectrum that resulted from ethyl acetate, we also monitored m/z 61, a mass fragment unique to ethyl acetate. By measuring the ratio of m/z 31 to m/z 61 observed while bypassing the reactor and flowing ethyl acetate directly to the RGA, the proportion of m/z 31 originating from ethyl acetate was determined. We multiplied this ratio by the observed m/z 61 signal and subtracted the result from m/z 31 to obtain a spectrum associated only with ethanol production. The results from this test are shown in Figure 8.For the experiment shown in Figure 8, 200 mg of the ceria support was diluted in 1.8 g of SiC and pretreated at 300 Â°C in 30 sccm of air for 1 h. The system was then cooled to 80 Â°C and flushed with 50 sccm of Ar for 30 min. Ethyl acetate was introduced first to a gas line that bypasses the reactor via the syringe pump at a rate of 8 Î¼L/min to establish baseline signals for m/z 61 and m/z 31. Once the signals had stabilized, the flow stream was switched to the reactor and the ethyl acetate was exposed to the ceria bed. This switch occurred at 1.5 min in Figure 8. Upon switching the flow to the reactor, the signals initially decayed as the ethyl acetate made its way through the residence volume of the reactor, which had previously contained only Ar. A sharp increase in m/z 31 and a peak were observed at â¼3 min in Figure 8, while the signal for m/z 61 did not display such a peak and increased continuously before saturating at the baseline level. The peak for m/z 31 corresponds to ethanol production, which increased rapidly after 3 min and then decayed back to the baseline.The RGA results in Figure 8 show that ethanol was generated when ethyl acetate was exposed to the ceria surface. These results and the ATR-IR spectrum for the ceria sample treated in ethyl acetate indicate that ethyl acetate can react with water on the ceria surface to generate ethanol and surface acetates. Thus, once the oxidation has been performed by the Au nanoparticles, the production of ethyl acetate vs acetic acid may depend largely upon the chemistry that occurs on the support. This conclusion is consistent with the results of several previous studies. For example, in the selective oxidation of alcohols, Enache et al. observed that gold supported on more acidic oxides (e.g., Fe2O3) exhibited higher selectivity for ester production than gold supported on other oxides (e.g., SiO2 and TiO2).(18) Surface acid sites have also been shown to catalyze the esterification of acetic acid with ethanol on mesoporous aluminosilicate.(67) Ceria exhibits strong acidâbase pair sites on its surface,(23) and our observations are consistent with these sites acting to promote the esterification reaction.We first address the role of water in ethanol oxidation to acetaldehyde, where water promotes the reaction at lower pressures and then inhibits the reaction at higher water contents, as observed in the kinetic data shown in Figure 3. The mild promoting effect, as suggested by the IR data, is in mitigating carboxylate formation at or near the Au active sites. Similar to effects on CO oxidation, reducing carboxylate poisoning leaves a larger number of Au sites available to perform ethanol oxidation.(51, 59) As the feedwater content and water coverage increases, water prevents ethanol from accessing the active sites, thus inhibiting the reaction.The mechanistic details of the secondary oxidation of acetaldehyde to ethyl acetate are more complicated, as the process requires a second oxidation of acetaldehyde, followed by condensation with ethanol. An appropriate explanation must take into account the following pieces of kinetic evidence: (i) primary KIE, indicating that ethyl acetate production is controlled by an elementary step that includes the transfer of an exchangeable proton, (ii) inhibition of ethyl acetate production by water, and (iii) reduced reaction order in ethanol when water is present. Assuming that acetaldehyde oxidation proceeds by a similar mechanism as ethanol oxidation involving hydride transfer to gold, our KIE data indicate that this step cannot be rate-determining for ethyl acetate production.Two likely (but related) reaction pathways for the production of ethyl acetate are shown in Scheme 1. In the direct pathway, a hydride transfer from acetaldehyde to Au results in a stabilized carbocation, which can react directly with ethanol. A subsequent proton transfer yields ethyl acetate. The reactive carbocation, however, can also react via the same mechanism with water or a surface hydroxyl group, yielding surface acetates. Given the relatively low reaction temperature (80 Â°C) and the strong binding of acetates on the ceria surface, only ethyl acetate can readily desorb from the surface. The fraction of activated acetaldehyde molecules that goes down each path depends largely on the coverages and availability of water, ethanol, and support OH groups.Both the direct route and acetate route are viable pathways for ethyl acetate generation; the pathway at work largely depends on the specific conditions and surface coverages present. We limit the following discussion to developing an understanding of the chemistry occurring during the steady-state conditions under which the kinetic data was collected. The direct pathway involves a proton transfer step; however, that step is likely to be very fast and is therefore inconsistent with the observed KIE. The hydride transfer step at the beginning of the direct pathway is also inconsistent with the observed KIE because it does not involve an exchangeable proton. The attack of ethanol on the carbocation is likely to have a strong dependence on the ethanol coverage and is consistent with the large ethanol reaction order; however, this step is also inconsistent with the observed KIE. Thus, under steady-state conditions, the direct route is generally inconsistent with our kinetic data. It may, however, operate under different reaction conditions.The second pathway involves the acid-catalyzed condensation of ethanol with a surface acetate. The initial reactions are likely equilibrated with the direct mechanism under steady-state conditions. However, since only the volatile ethyl acetate is observed, and the IR spectra of the surface species are not readily distinguishable, we can only monitor changes to the path that leads to ethyl acetate and are blind to any other changes in the equilibria. The addition of water should decrease the surface coverage of ethanol, shifting the equilibria away from the production of ethyl acetate, which is generally consistent with the observed changes in the reaction kinetics when water was added to the system.This proposed mechanism is also consistent with the large primary KIE associated with ethyl acetate production, as a proton transfer to the adsorbed intermediate immediately precedes the production of ethyl acetate. The control experiment in Figure 8 shows that the ceria support can catalyze the saponification of ethyl acetate; it should therefore be an active catalyst for the esterification of acetate and ethanol. The change in ethanol reaction order for ethyl acetate production in the presence and absence of water is also consistent with this mechanism. The acid-catalyzed reaction requires proton carriers on the surface. In the absence of water, ethanol, which is more mobile than acetate, is the most likely proton carrier. A protonated ethanol would then be required to initiate the saponification reaction, explaining the large reaction order in ethanol. Water is a better proton carrier than ethanol; therefore, the addition of water reduces the effects of ethanol on this step. Thus, the acetate pathway depicted in Scheme 1 is consistent with all of the observed kinetic data for ethyl acetate production. We also note that the direct route is likely to be the dominant route in the absence of acetate and water, as is likely to be the case when the feed is first introduced to the catalyst. Some of the observed reactivity differences between the wet and dry feeds may be attributable to changing contributions of the direct route to the overall ethyl acetate production.In previous studies, we showed that water can influence the reaction pathways and product selectivity observed for allyl alcohol oxidation on the oxygen-covered Au(111) surface.(44, 45) Here, we have shown that water can influence the various reaction pathways in different ways under the same set of conditions on the same catalyst. Including water in the reactor system may be used as a tool to tune the selectivity of alcohol oxidation reactions. Furthermore, water, which is frequently present in reactor systems as an impurity or byproduct, may play an unrecognized role in many other reactions, influencing both catalytic activities and product distributions. Controlling water content in the catalyst bed may prove influential in directing the kinetic behavior of many systems.Both oxidative dehydrogenation and esterification of ethanol were promoted via an Au/CeO2 catalyst in a fixed-bed flow reactor at 80 Â°C, resulting in the production of acetaldehyde and ethyl acetate, respectively. The behavior of this catalyst was altered by incorporating water into the reactant feed stream, resulting in shifts in the activity and selectivity for acetaldehyde and ethyl acetate production. The inclusion of water in the feed stream at partial pressures below 7 kPa promoted the dehydrogenation process, increasing the activity for acetaldehyde production. The ethanol esterification process was also influenced by water. Introducing water into the reactor feed stream led to changes in the activity displayed by the system for ethyl acetate production and brought about a 4-fold decrease in the ethanol reaction order. Furthermore, a primary KIE was measured upon replacing this H2O in the feed stream with D2O and upon replacing ethanol with d-ethanol.These observations are consistent with previously proposed dehydrogenation mechanisms involving aldehyde production resulting from the formation of a surface alkoxide on the support and subsequent hydride transfer to gold. However, our kinetic data suggest that, under steady-state conditions, ethyl acetate production proceeds via the acid-catalyzed condensation of ethanol with an acetate on the ceria surface. While gold is required to promote hydride transfer (from either the adsorbed alkoxide or aldehyde), all of the subsequent chemistry associated with ester production can be explained by transformations occurring on the ceria surface. These pathways are strongly influenced by coverages of surface species adsorbed on the support and the availability of protons (and potentially hydroxide ions). These results demonstrate the important role that the support material can play beyond simply acting as a dispersant for the âactiveâ phase.Additionally, our results suggest that water plays an important role in dictating the kinetics of the ethanol oxidative coupling process. Water influenced both ethanol oxidative transformations catalyzed by Au/CeO2 and did so in different ways. Controlling water content in the reactor system may, therefore, be a key parameter in tuning the selectivity of these processes. The influence of water on gold-catalyzed oxidation reactions has now been documented in several studies, but oxidation reactions are only one class of conversion process important to the present and future of catalysis. Other transformations such as hydrogenation and carbonâcarbon coupling also play important roles in the production of industrial chemicals, and water may prove to influence these processes in previously undiscovered ways as well. Understanding waterâs role in reactions such as these may provide important insights that inform the design of future generations of catalysts.AbbreviationsATR-IRattenuated total reflectance infraredDFTdensity functional theoryEDSenergy dispersive X-ray spectroscopyGCgas chromatographyHAADF-STEMhigh angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron micrsocopyICP-MSinductively coupled plasma mass spectrometryKIEkinetic isotope effectRGAresidual gas analysisTOFturnover frequencyXRDX-ray diffraction
